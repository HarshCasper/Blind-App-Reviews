SRE teams are sometimes spread thin enough to make deep technical contributions infeasible, so the path to higher-levels is almost always for driving large programmes, rather for primarily-technical contribution/leadership.Leadership only talk in press-release corpspeak under the assumption that most of it will indeed be leaked to the press. Leaders won't take a stand on anything, since with 300k employees any kind of definite statement will anger at least a few thousand people. As a result, the don't be evil motto has become something like try to keep the outrage down to an acceptable level of grumbling - it could be worse, but it's not very inspiring.It's not bad, you just won't find fast implementations, focused missions or strong values, at least not any more.",

The problem comes where the next level is really a different job than the current level (eg. L6->L7), and OKR planning doesn't align with your career goals (L7 impact is hard to come by).It's harder and harder to be innovative in SRE, due to size. Planning cycles are getting longer, with more approvals. Career growth depends on your manager, and SRE historically has been bad at growing good managers inside, so we hired a lot of L5/L6 managers from outside (which do know really understand the promo process until a few years down the road). Promo committees are the real decider of promos, but it's harder to do when your manager cannot provide good feedback to know what to correct.DEI is all the rage now, with lots of talks, but most manager don't follow their words with effective actions.Compensations/benefits for SRE is stagnating, there is no real competition if you are tied to ZRH or Switzerland for personal reasons.",

It's weird that they changed the policy in 2019 to be that TVCs are no longer included in the share setting of Anyone at Alphabet, but FTEs were surprised/confused to get requests from a temp like me, and I had to find out for them why I didn't have access to their document shared to all.

I just don't understand how they don't say or realize how much more % of time/effort TVCs put forth to actually get to access and do work, especially for UXRs handling sensitive data or prior research without either a FTE UXR colleague or team know-how to help clear the way a bit more for a TVC noogler. They never acknowledge how disruptive it is. Maybe just that would be nice to hear. Maybe I'm way off base and expected too much and should be like some others and just be grateful for the opportunity, (I am) but this has been part of my experience, too. I'd like to hear if others who are TVC UXRs have had similar experiences. ",

Practically speaking, career growth RATE is capped so that engineers that are far below their potential are artificially slowed down in career progression in order to align everyone to a singular performance measurement model.For most engineers, throttled growth rate is a good thing, however it has the net effect of encouraging over-achievers to leave (though many return later at L+2).

If you find yourself on a bad team do not hesitate to transfer ASAP - 1 year after being on the team.Do not try to be a hero and stick it out - get out of there. Also, KEY ADVICE for people who are joining as Nooglers: Ask any perspective future manager to share their Googlegeist scores. What's Googlegeist? Every manager/org is scored by their reports across a set of metrics - pay particular attention to retention (if the % of people who want to leave the team is significantly greater than the average across Google, what does that tell you?) Is this conversation with your potential future boss a bit awkward when you are a star-struck Noogler during the team match phase and you want everyone to like you? Yes, it is. Is it essential you do it so that you don't unknowingly end up on a bad team? Yes, it is. Did I know about Googlegeist when I joined?No I didn't, which I ended up regretting rather deeply, and is why I give this advice here.",

They pay 80 - 95% of the top of the market and they rely on their name brand (and perceived prestige) to make up for the rest. If you're an experienced professional, not a recent grad, they will down-level you on the way in. So if you were a 6 at your previous company, expect a 4 or 5 at Google. Some of this makes sense because Google has it's own way of doing things and you really need to learn how to work within the company's internal framework to level up, but it's frustrating - the leveling is not consistent across the company, at least in my case it wasn't. I had two reports at my last company who also came to Google, but they leveled in higher than I did. Promotions take a very long time and until you learn how to gear all of your work towards what you're measured on (which may not align with what's actually good for the product), you will not advance.

Most orgs if run efficiently can make do with half the resources.

That inevitably leads to code review comments asking why you didn't just refactor the world to fix a bug.Their process is a mess too. We are always in firefighting mode. Tasks are very poorly defined. We have sprints but sprint planning is basically just an extra long standup where we also say what we plan to work on next. If there's a long-term vision, it only exists in my manager's head.Speaking of managers, Google really embraces engineers who manage. This means that one of your fellow developers is in charge of your career, performance reviews, raises, bonuses, etc. When you pick a team, try to find a team with a dedicated full-time manager.This has been one of the worst experiences of my career.

Together businesses around these account for like 95 percent of the revenue. So basically people here invent problems to work on. Nothing is really necessary in the grand scheme of things except keep the clusters running so you can keep serving those web requests.What is really happening here is basically that people are trying to stand out. There is an ideal of a Google engineer, that they're smart can churn out code at Will can guide products etc. everybody is graded along that ideal by people who have already made it because of being earlier than you.

I've watched trajectories grow from MGR - Global Director in a matter of 2-3 years 2012-2017. Now it takes 2x longer with much more aggressive targets and workload. Work/Life balance feels impossible bc Google is a reward for performance company. Caveat is, everyone performs at the top of their game - so Google gets everyone's best and then forces a bell curve on performance rating/assessments (only recognizes some). If youre looking for stable pay and strong equity value/benefits and are ok with limited growth trajectory and feeling under rewarded for your contributions, I don't think you'll find many things to be upset about here!

Performance reviews are meant for you to demonstrate your individual contribution and leadership impact, so its objective and fair. So a lot of ambitious people are focused on their own impact to win the promotion game instead of everyone in a team or dept working together for the team to meet an OKR.- a LOT of time, effort, and energy spent on perf reviews and promotion cycles. imho the opportunity cost of this time is quite expensive.- with a big team, and big company, your communication and political awareness must be on point, otherwise you'll never get anything done. Getting alignment is a commonly used phrase, which is a lot harder and more complicated than you realize, but critical to getting anything to launch.- there are a lot of brilliant and ambitious people working here. which is great, but as noted above, the individual incentives and assessment for objectivity and not taking others' credit, makes it really hard to stand out.

Which means if you want to grow your career Google is not the place, since Google isn't a growing company. But you can get by fine doing very little work at Google. This leads to the best people leaving over time, and then more and more of the company just coasts.The folks who built key systems are gone, reliability is a problem but investing in code and health and reliability is a promotion dead end. Better to launch garbage that gets deprecated 2 years later.Perf process rewards ownership of ideas and initiatives, which disincentives cooperation and encourages credit stealing.All the best of the interesting and smart people from the first decade at Google are gone, as the culture died. The only ones left are the worst of the bunch. Overall, a strong mid-80s IBM vibe but worse dressed and more whimsical.",

The internal performance review creates a culture of everything having to be optimized for this process. It rewards complexity and amount, so expect a ton of bloated overly complex code that doesn't need to exist. - The internal culture is a ghost of its former self. You'll keep seeing people glorify the good old days every time there's a new internal controversy about Google doing something for money. Instead of a university campus, it now feels more like standard issue corporate america. You're expected to act and behave as of you had passion and gave a shit, when in reality no one gives a shit about you and you're just a code grunt.- If you join am established team, you spend most of your days wrangling high level configuration files on legacy systems that keep bloating. You don't really learn anything new besides how to use this internal api that no one else in the world cares about. You might join a new team and get to write more interesting code though. - It took me a bit more than 1 year to go through the hiring pipeline.

Seems like most of the company wouldn't have been qualified to work here even 5 years ago- Bad leveling system. A lot of people are at higher levels only because they work in bad orgs/teams with easier promos, but end up being compensated the same as others at same level on better teams working on harder problems or more important products.- Compensation is not competitive for levels below L6.- A lot of bad management because engineers are often not good managers- Too many people on work visas who don't care about the company culture and don't have your best interests in mind- Once cutting edge tools and infrastructure are now feeling very dated and way behind open source tools- A lot of teams don't have enough work to go around compared to head count, so there is a lot of infighting between teams and orgs for work, and even duplication of efforts.- Old company culture took a hit when Sundar took over, and is eroding all of the time. Most orgs feel like any other big company.- Food is bad now, perks not so great anymore. The company has grown up, lots is appeal and is boring.",
