One can always find variety and novelty in the projects to work on, skills to learn, and leadership development opportunities are there for the taking.","My diagnosis is that Google has grown too big, and didn't quite solve the human coordination problem. It's over 100k full-time employees and over 200k contract/TVC, the cize of a small city, if you can imagine the city council (managers) numbering 40k.Alignment meetings and planning have become substantial overhead, with most worthwhile changes require multiple team buy-in, roadmaps 3-6 months in advance and multi-quarter implementations. SRE teams are sometimes spread thin enough to make deep technical contributions infeasible, so the path to higher-levels is almost always for driving large programmes, rather for primarily-technical contribution/leadership.Leadership only talk in press-release corpspeak under the assumption that most of it will indeed be leaked to the press. Leaders won't take a stand on anything, since with 300k employees any kind of definite statement will anger at least a few thousand people. As a result, the don't be evil motto has become something like try to keep the outrage down to an acceptable level of grumbling - it could be worse, but it's not very inspiring.It's not bad, you just won't find fast implementations, focused missions or strong values, at least not any more.","Verified User Current Employee g***** Site Reliability Engineer - Apr 27, 2022",

Most folks are really nice and eager to help.People seem mature and work hard, but also seem like they mostly have good work-life-balance and boundaries. (Managers seem stretched thin, though.) There's always someone who is going above and beyond... whether that's good or bad is up for grabs.TVC life is different than FTEs and we don't get a lot of the same financial perks and benefits and training. I'm glad we don't have to do Perf (performance review cycles), though, which seems dreadful and no one (FTEs ICs/Managers) seems to like it. :)","My first months were spent asking hundreds of folks I had not met for access to files in files in files, tools, sites, data, required training, etc. and the time and effort to do that while trying to actually do work and get a handle on the way of things was absolutely exhausting, and the slog seemed so backward. It's weird that they changed the policy in 2019 to be that TVCs are no longer included in the share setting of Anyone at Alphabet, but FTEs were surprised/confused to get requests from a temp like me, and I had to find out for them why I didn't have access to their document shared to all. These hurdles have made it harder than necessary for me to do my job, and it has frankly sucked the will out of me quite a bit to do the actual work. Randomly, sometimes new quarters require re-asking for access to things. Not a day goes by where I don't have to ask for access to something (but maybe that's everyone? no idea, I wouldn't know since I'm not on a team that chats with each other outside of projects). Anyway. It's still Google, so it's not that bad. I just don't understand how they don't say or realize how much more % of time/effort TVCs put forth to actually get to access and do work, especially for UXRs handling sensitive data or prior research without either a FTE UXR colleague or team know-how to help clear the way a bit more for a TVC noogler. They never acknowledge how disruptive it is. Maybe just that would be nice to hear. Maybe I'm way off base and expected too much and should be like some others and just be grateful for the opportunity, (I am) but this has been part of my experience, too.

Being a contract UXR at Google is not a bad choice.","- Your career growth opportunity and experience highly depends on the team you work on. So, don't be afraid of changing teams if your current team is not a good fit. - As a contractor, initially I was offered $35/hr as a Ph.D. grad in the Bay Area! We need to fight for higher salaries. Do some research on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc., and always ask for higher salaries if your offer is not good enough. - Your job level does not reflect your academia background and sometimes the tasks you are assigned. I was hired as a research assistant (UX research II - level 2). For a regular FTE UXR jobs, almost all Ph.D. grads joined the company as an L4. - You won't be treated as a full-time employee. You will be excluded from all formal career growth opportunities. Everyone has different opinions about this one. In my case, it is more important for me to get working experience no matter what.

If you have a great manager, life is good. Of course, this is true anywhere, but the point I want to highlight is that if you're on a bad team in a great company, you're going to be miserable. If you find yourself on a bad team do not hesitate to transfer ASAP - 1 year after being on the team.Do not try to be a hero and stick it out - get out of there. Also, KEY ADVICE for people who are joining as Nooglers: Ask any perspective future manager to share their Googlegeist scores. What's Googlegeist? Every manager/org is scored by their reports across a set of metrics - pay particular attention to retention (if the % of people who want to leave the team is significantly greater than the average across Google, what does that tell you?) Is this conversation with your potential future boss a bit awkward when you are a star-struck Noogler during the team match phase and you want everyone to like you? Yes, it is. Is it essential you do it so that you don't unknowingly end up on a bad team? Yes, it is.

They pay 80 - 95% of the top of the market and they rely on their name brand (and perceived prestige) to make up for the rest. If you're an experienced professional, not a recent grad, they will down-level you on the way in. So if you were a 6 at your previous company, expect a 4 or 5 at Google. Some of this makes sense because Google has it's own way of doing things and you really need to learn how to work within the company's internal framework to level up, but it's frustrating - the leveling is not consistent across the company, at least in my case it wasn't. I had two reports at my last company who also came to Google, but they leveled in higher than I did.

They hire even worse people so as to not be shown up- then blame the poor results on not having enough resources, and further bloat their orgs with consultants and more hires with absurd justifications for even more headcount. Most orgs if run efficiently can make do with half the resources. Most people to me seem content restnig and vesting- love having Google on their Linkedin for social status, check in and check out on-time everyday focusing on other things in their lives.

4,Quite different,"This isn't really like working in a company that needs to sell something to someone to make money. That's very important to understand because that flows into everything else that happens here.The company makes a humongous amount of money on data it doesn't own. Plus search unlike every other product is not right or wrong, it's just giving you links based on some metric it thinks is right. YouTube again is videos posted by others. Together businesses around these account for like 95 percent of the revenue. So basically people here invent problems to work on. Nothing is really necessary in the grand scheme of things except keep the clusters running so you can keep serving those web requests.What is really happening here is basically that people are trying to stand out. There is an ideal of a Google engineer, that they're smart can churn out code at Will can guide products etc. everybody is graded along that ideal by people who have already made it because of being earlier than you. Overall it's a great place to work. You would be intellectually challenged if you go and seek it. Food is great, coworkers are far better than average. You get paid far higher than industry average and the company really has no competitors.","Because you don't really work on a product, your impact is only as much as you can make people believe.Chances of upward career progression is a big lottery.

It's very rare for someone to be non PC and get away with it. It's a pro because it prevents most internal politics from getting personally toxic.,"- Everyone in my team is working at least 10 hours a day. The performance bar is set by whatever your team is doing. You can't just say I'll work 8 hours like I'm paid because you'll just have poor performance.- Perf is everything. The internal performance review creates a culture of everything having to be optimized for this process. It rewards complexity and amount, so expect a ton of bloated overly complex code that doesn't need to exist. - The internal culture is a ghost of its former self. You'll keep seeing people glorify the good old days every time there's a new internal controversy about Google doing something for money. Instead of a university campus, it now feels more like standard issue corporate america. You're expected to act and behave as of you had passion and gave a shit, when in reality no one gives a shit about you and you're just a code grunt.- If you join am established team, you spend most of your days wrangling high level configuration files on legacy systems that keep bloating. You don't really learn anything new besides how to use this internal api that no one else in the world cares about. You might join a new team and get to write more interesting code though. - It took me a bit more than 1 year to go through the hiring pipeline. Team match was a limbo where I didn't know what was going to happen for months.- Perks are non-existent with WFH. - Compensation is mediocre.

If you're curious, design docs and post-mortems are accessible and most people are friendly enough to provide additional insight if you ask. The culture is not cut-throat in most teams (at least at the lower levels) and given that many prioritize WLB, there are lot of teams where you can take on increased responsibilities. Good WLB and details on compensation are widely known.","If you're not a go-getter, it's easy to stall here career-wise.

It's on you to find a good team and project that's a good fit for your goals, to be self-aware of issues in yourself and your team, and to switch if need-be. If you're looking to grow your product skills, there are better places to go.
