2.0,Good brand. Poor compensation.,"- Even though it's not a strong name in the tech world, it's still a good brand and can help you get noticed.- Nice environment for graduates- Travelling and paid expenses can be fun","- Not the place to make money as a technical contributor. It will take you 6-8 years to make the same you could in 2 years working elsewhere.This is because the consulting framework is applied no matter the role you have, so although you might be promoted every two years, the pay is still significantly below market. - Your experience will depend mostly on the projects you are on, and rarely a project will have the perfect combination of interesting work, nice client/project team, and cool location. You may get the first two for example and be in the middle of nowhere. - It feels like you are constantly looking for a job. That's because you are (in most cases). You have to keep your CV always up to date, network to be recommended to projects, interview for roles, and can be rolled off your project at any time. Unless you want out of the project.

Basically, if they didn't think you suffered enough, they don't think you've earned it.

Which means the mobility will allow you to enjoy different work experiences with reasonably similar level of market (1 - 2 tier).",There are unspoken hierarchies among service lines ( Audit/Tax < Advisory < Consulting < Strategy Consulting ) and I honestly think it hurts morale. Cross functional collaboration can be very fun but can also be a lot of headache due to politics depending on the people.

That's your salary at Deloitte. People squabble over 4% vs 9% raises, meanwhile the equivalent personnel at any FAANG are making 100 - 200% more (equivalent personnel being tech sales, SWE, or PM).Also, the company does not distinguish between consultants who write code and tech salespeople. These two categories of people are both considered tech consultants and there is no pay bump whatsoever if you are savvy enough to write code for the client. Guess what this results in? Most good technical resources leave to get paid fairly elsewhere and those who remain are either focusing on family or are too busy chilling to worry about getting compensated fairly. Oddly enough, there are actually people here who have great skills but somehow they are not ambitious enough to leave and double or triple their salary. It boggles my mind.That said, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this chill attitude towards life. But if you care about money even in the slightest and are passionate about working with companies that actually define the future of tech, you will not be satisfied at Deloitte. What happens is the tech industry brings out new tech (like cloud, which is very old news by now), and then 10 years later Deloitte helps bring the now-10-year-old tech to clients who are even more outdated.","Verified User Current Employee  G********  Software Engineer - Apr 30, 2021",

Like a top-tier consulting firm, the travel perks are good. ","The work life balance is poor and the expectations are unreal. I have always been a top performer, working crazy hours and giving my all, but the leadership keeps  pushing you for more and more. The expectations on most of the projects are unrealistic where you are expected to work for the client 50-60 hours and then also drive all the fluff like the firm contribution/ proposals/ eminence devoting your weekdays and weekends for it. As I have mostly worked in banking/ fintech, the diversity is extremely poor and not promoted. I was part of a project where all the men around me had this habit of constantly interrupting each other and me ( of course), raising voices frequently at each other and when I tried raising this as a concern, they pretended to listen to me but never changed anything about it and called my expectation of treating other team members nicely and with respect as something that can only bother a girl on the project. Even if you are a top performer, leadership loves to make you jump through hoops to get promoted. I was being told after 4 months of making a manager that ai should be doing more else I will not make it to a Senior Manager which promotion was few years away. The compensation is bad if you compare the average hours you put in per week and the family time you sacrificed in travel, client work and all the fluff firm expects you to do to be a top performer.

I am a high performer being paid 10% more than a first year because they decided to bump up first years starting salary without correcting anyone else's salary.

Despite being a high performer and receiving above average raises every year, I'm now only making 10% more than someone who just started. Don't even get me started on the wfh meals (hint there are none). Despite working 14 hours a day to meet tight deadlines during busy season, its firm policy that we cannot expense meals at home, due to tax implications. With all these IPOs and SPACs going on, our company is thriving but our pay and benefits do not reflect that. The firm is constantly developing new technology that is worse than the technology it is intended to replace. Omnia is burning a ton of cash and doesnt even work properly. Upper management is constantly ranting and raving about how great it is and how it will increase audit efficiency. I haven't seen that and after working in it for a year, I can confidently tell you that it is a failed project. Ridden with bugs, in-optimization, and over-engineered solutions, Omnia has increased my workload and frustration levels beyond what benefits the platform could possibly provide.

","Verified User Former Employee  U*****  Solutions Analyst - Oct 31, 2020","Company failed to follow its own official policy when it comes to promotion or compensation. Deloitte performance review is score based, on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being highest.I worked for ~2 years, maintaining on avg. 95% utilization and received a 1 for both years. So, at the 2nd 6 month review, I requested for promotion. Management told me that barring any hiccups, I was set for promotion. At year end review, despite maintaining the same work ethic and utilization rate, my promotion was being denied because I hadn't worked long enough at the company to qualify for promotion. No where in HR documents is it explicitly or implicitly written that a resource must have x amount of years to qualify for promotion. In fact the official message from Talent was performance the only factor for promotion. I later found out that others who were up for promotion were also denied for the exact reason. In fact the MD that boomeranged from Accenture, just brought over people from Accenture to fill in for the positions we were up for. Management assured me that in lieu of promotion they would make it up to me in compensation. When it came to compensation time, I got a cost of living adjustment and no bonus. I left the company and found a job that pays 2x more in a month. "

4.0,Great culture but hard to find work life balance in Consulting,"1. The company's ethics, values, employee friendly culture is in place.2. The work life balance in non client facing teams is pretty decent3. Appraisals are good (have been so far for me atleast)4. Having an understanding and open-to-ideas manager/team lead helps to get a decent appraisal and promotion5. Internal mobility is being promoted a lot since Covid but they are (until now) limited to only few Service Lines (could be due to more growth in those Service Lines).. But if there is opening in a SL of your choice, things can move fast","Sharing this specifically for Consulting:1. They expect you to do multiple things at the same.time and also expect u to work majorly on all weekends (barring a few may be) and won't bother to ask you if u r available to work on weekend before committing deadline to client2. They will ask u to work for 60 hrs a week but allow you to put only 20 hrs on the Timesheet!! So utilisation goes for a toss3. The coach (the one who looks after your appraisal) may not bother to speak to you except during year end appraisal cycle and more often than not is unaware of what u r working on (Coach is different from your Manager)4. The work can get monotonous for some as a lot of work is based on what Deloitte has done with other clients.. so if u worked on a Transaction Advisory project, chances are u will get more of the same kind of projects since u have experience there5. Senior managers/Directors/Partners have the habit of biting off more than they can chew so they will have crazy ongoing projects which are already understaffed but will still bid for newer projects and they will take these resources from these very (understaffed) projects n ask them to finish the Proposal in 3-4 days so they can work on the current project over the weekend!","Verified User Current Employee  a******  Senior Consultant - Oct 21, 2020",
