Many ecomm people left rather than move to Bentonville, and our ability to manage that side of the business has suffered dramatically. Work loads have also increased dramatically and are part of the reason the high attrition continues. Our tech tools are buggy and inhibit ability to do our job. Management talks about being responsive to our needs but so far, very little at all has changed. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the things we are now responsible for, post-reorganization. We used to have tema of 8-9 managing ecomm, and 1-2 managing B&M.

This seems to maybe risking of having a culture of professional trust derived from comfortable personal relations rather than special merit, this seems for special roles, like for engineering, technical. It is not what I mean as favoritism, but equivalent in effects when happening2. Managing the manager very difficult seemingly, perhaps for reason above in #1?3. Similar as #2, big insulation from next level manager/s and beyond. I have not any ideas about what standing a manager in my line has with their manager. A lot of game of telephone?4. Continuing the themes, politics within area and across business are not transparent. Politics are expected at a company of the size, the valuation but politics remain hidden. Some may prefer things that way?5. Dead weight is celebrated for causes of diversity, disagreeable weight is cut for causes of a big happy family. It seems to easy to release very smart mildly aggressive 5-10 year staff, but no 20 year staff feeling pressures seemingly, especially meaning diversity groups in US. 6. Based in the southern United States. Work remotely after COVID, but hard to communicate well. Work at HQ and you're in an area not like other parts of the US. If you are from the Southern area then maybe this is Pro7. The company have expectation of living the company attitude, put on your happy face, assertiveness can easily take an appearance of aggression or politically incorrectness. This is specific to your personality, if it feels ok to lose an argument when right, then it won't be so bad for you.These cons, many are easy understandable. Because, risk aversion, for a very large company in the stock market is what is normal. So taking this to mind with a grain of salt!Long list of cons, but this job is for me for now and I don't feel upset at any peer, supervisor, subordinate, etc. Hard to get mad at this company.",

It percolates down to developers and without clear requirements people start faking research activity. Then deadline happen and project get moved, repeat, and then it's cancelled.Segmentation. Teams are not aligned under common goal and schedule, making improvements to cross-system concerns is beyond impossible. In all-hands meetings management repeats mantra highly independent, tightly aligned teams but nobody dears to ask what does it mean.Result does not matter, show-off is the objective. In all activities, delivering result does not feel as the objective. Most of the time disussions is around how to present what the team did. This leads to oversaturation, hiding empty hands behind pathetic but sophisticated sounding terminology and all tricks to fake activity. It hurts morale of good engineers because fake masters are successful whereas skills and results will give you nothing.",
