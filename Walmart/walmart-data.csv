Many ecomm people left rather than move to Bentonville, and our ability to manage that side of the business has suffered dramatically. Work loads have also increased dramatically and are part of the reason the high attrition continues. Our tech tools are buggy and inhibit ability to do our job. Management talks about being responsive to our needs but so far, very little at all has changed.

Very friendly and caring feel to it for focus on ethics, social issues, family and personal needs2. Work-life balance wonderful when comparing as large non-tech companies. Managers genuinely care about your happiness, or project the care enough so that it doesn't matter if genuine is really it3. Job security is good, it seems when the time is to say you need to leave, you will know before, except for if ethical problems happen. Then you go today, not next year!4. Total compensation is good, but not amazing. I'm happy enough, some complain","1. Managers are managers, means that they often do not know the special area. This works sometimes, other times not. This seems to maybe risking of having a culture of professional trust derived from comfortable personal relations rather than special merit, this seems for special roles, like for engineering, technical. It is not what I mean as favoritism, but equivalent in effects when happening2. Managing the manager very difficult seemingly, perhaps for reason above in #1?3. Similar as #2, big insulation from next level manager/s and beyond. I have not any ideas about what standing a manager in my line has with their manager. A lot of game of telephone?4. Continuing the themes, politics within area and across business are not transparent. Politics are expected at a company of the size, the valuation but politics remain hidden. Some may prefer things that way?5. Dead weight is celebrated for causes of diversity, disagreeable weight is cut for causes of a big happy family. It seems to easy to release very smart mildly aggressive 5-10 year staff, but no 20 year staff feeling pressures seemingly, especially meaning diversity groups in US. 6. Based in the southern United States. Work remotely after COVID, but hard to communicate well. Work at HQ and you're in an area not like other parts of the US. If you are from the Southern area then maybe this is Pro7. The company have expectation of living the company attitude, put on your happy face, assertiveness can easily take an appearance of aggression or politically incorrectness. This is specific to your personality, if it feels ok to lose an argument when right, then it won't be so bad for you.These cons, many are easy understandable. Because, risk aversion, for a very large company in the stock market is what is normal.

3.0,Backwater,People are goodюWork-life balance is good. Environment is not demanding and you can do all you need to show in half a day and spend rest of it doing whatever you want.,"Universally poor project management. Requirements for year-long program can consist of 4 sentences and 2 pictures. Complex project planning is performed in confluence tables. It percolates down to developers and without clear requirements people start faking research activity. Then deadline happen and project get moved, repeat, and then it's cancelled.Segmentation. Teams are not aligned under common goal and schedule, making improvements to cross-system concerns is beyond impossible. In all-hands meetings management repeats mantra highly independent, tightly aligned teams but nobody dears to ask what does it mean.Result does not matter, show-off is the objective. In all activities, delivering result does not feel as the objective. Most of the time disussions is around how to present what the team did. This leads to oversaturation, hiding empty hands behind pathetic but sophisticated sounding terminology and all tricks to fake activity. It hurts morale of good engineers because fake masters are successful whereas skills and results will give you nothing.","Verified User Current Employee  c*****  Principal Software Engineer - May 15, 2020",
