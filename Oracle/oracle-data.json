			"cons": "Lots of talent left/leaving the past year, both ICs and management, many people who probably reached their 4 year mark from OCI's hiring burst for Gen 2 cloud. Internal tooling and build system needs a lot of work. Oracle/OCI seems pretty cheap with resources, versus other big tech. Focus on security/privacy is good in principle, but also means lack of using any cloud/online- based tools (i.e. GSuite), which is a hindrance to productivity/organization. Org shifts/changes every other month. Big downside of 2021 is huge shift of all production service teams from development work to region build (ops work), which may last half a year. Also, no WFH benefits (ex. stipend for equipment).",

			"cons": "Sales culture is incredibly toxic. It is clear the field reps have virtually no respect for the inside reps and actively try to not work with you. Furthermore, especially with forecasting OD roles, there is constant battling and backstabbing between inside and field reps which makes for a toxic environment and a bad experience for the customer. There are far too many reps selling the same product reaching out to customers. It is not unheard of to have a customer tell you that you are the X Oracle rep to reach out that day. Furthermore due to vague KPIs and most roles using a stack ranking for compensation, a lot of people cheat and put fake metrics on the board with very little oversight. After getting promoted into the OD role, there is little path forward. Typically you'd have to try for BDC management which seems to be less viable as less BDCs are being hired. Furthermore getting to the field is difficult as they do not respect the Class Of program. I've watched over half the BDCs I was onboarded with leave the company and half my OD org leave Oracle as well. It seems with the passing of Mark Hurd the inside sales role is slowly but surely being diminished. ",

Oracle lets you be a true 9-5 employee, and if (like me) you know you're not going to be at Oracle long-term and don't care to impress management, lets you actually enjoy weekends and evenings off. Also, as a college grad in a new city, Oracle's massive hiring of other young new hires makes for great networking and friend-making. This is a huge plus, it's seriously great for meeting new people.Post-covid (right now): At least Oracle is stable. Besides that, none. I mean, sure, the good work-life balance is still there, but Oracle has not handled the WFH transition gracefully, meaning that I (and many other engineers I speak to) am being underutilized. As a result, I have a lot of downtime.",
			"cons": "Pre AND Post-covid: Man, there are a lot. Let's be clear - they underpay us by a lot compared to the rest of the industry. We all know it. And they wonder why people take jobs elsewhere? Come on. Also - your recruiter will lie to you about how much you'll make. Mine did. They'll tell you that everyone gets their max bonus (for those in sales/sales-adjacent organizations) but this hasn't been this case in my or my friends/colleagues time here. Since starting I've made probably 30-40% of that bonus number they give you when they're recruiting you. And despite my complaining I do my job well, so I'm by no means an underperformer. My advice - ignore the bonus, assume you're going to make whatever it is your base is. Anything else beyond that Oracle will try and screw you out of.For anyone reading this as a recent or soon-to-be college grad - Oracle does nothing to help your personal development. They'll tell you to get certifications, but the disorganized management at almost every level means that you'll constantly be moved around between projects and technologies, leaving you no time to improve any *actual* skills. Now, you still can work on professional growth and development, but it is entirely up to you. You have to scout out opportunities to learn about what you're interested in, and improve at it, most of the time taking on side projects that you work on in downtime/your own time. People joke that careers come here to die and this is 100% true *unless* you spend a lot of time developing your skills on your own so that you can market them to the recruiter for your next job.Listen. I went to a good school where we were taught the importance of diversity - in thought, in leadership, and in teams. Let me tell you right now - Oracle is loaded up with boring and uninspiring middle-aged white guys in management (I'm a white dude myself, and I'm saying it's absurd). A bunch of yes-men. You will not get that cutting-edge, cool, tech (if you wanna call it that) culture that you'll get at almost any other big tech firm. Oracle feels more like an investment bank than a tech company and that's not a good thing.Again, I'm speaking to my people - the young, new, or recently-out-of-college peeps. Oracle's culture is like a time capsule back to pre-2008, where talking about basic diversity and cultural issues is taboo. This is *not* an ideologically progressive company or culture. And yeah, I'm sure I've probably lost some people by now, especially the middle-management boomers, and that's fine, this review isn't for you. If you, like me, are young, went to a good school, and grew up with friends that aren't the same race/religion/ethnicity/gender/anything else as you, you'll care about how the people here (especially the managers) could not give a **** about the varied experiences and sensitivities of people who aren't white guys. People here don't pronounce my black friends' names correctly, and don't care. People here cut off my female friends mid-sentence, and don't care. But hey, that's Oracle for ya!At this point I'm almost ranting, but I want to make it very clear that if you're a white (or South East Asian) man you will be fine here, but for anyone else you will experience all the ridiculous little biased micro-aggressions that you thought you'd be able to avoid by joining a good company. It's a shame that this company doesn't fix these problems which cause so many talented people to leave. It's 2020, wake up.",
