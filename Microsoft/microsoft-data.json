			"cons": "- Down side of the work/life balance is management doesn't hold teams accountable enough to deadlines. So it's hard to partner across orgs and expect they will deliver their component on time. It can be frustrating to feel like you're not moving forward quickly enough - career progression is heavily on your shoulders - it is also impacted heavily (for good or bad) by the relationship you have with your manager and skip.  For younger engineers I think this can be a struggle. Highly recommend having a respected mentor that is at least a band or two higher than you - Benefits are pretty great - one annoying thing is our health benefits are a high deductible HSA.  Luckily Microsoft covers most of the deductible (but only deposits their portion in two lumps sums, one of which is in the summer), so sometimes you get stuck doing the calculations and paperwork for reimbursements if you over/under pay earlier in the year- With the acquisition of Git Hub, LinkedIn, and standing up Azure as a Amazon compete \u2014 we've  hired (integrated) a lot of new personnel.  It's great for new ways of thinking \u2014 but there is an old guard vs new guard way of thinking in certain orgs.  People who have been in the company for 20 years have a this so how we've always done it mentality.  But it's very team dependent- Based upon my reviews here on Blind and Levels.fyi, it appears our annual stock awards are about half-ish (depending on level) of what the big FAANG's offer ",

There are still some old timers who are kind of bahhumbug but they will retire soon \ud83d\ude02- MSFT cares about employees as humans. Not only do benefits get better YoY, but the pandemic has proven to us that employees matter. We were one of the first companies to fully remote- Culture of growth mindset (it's okay to fail as long as you learn from it and share that with others), empathy, working on D&I, and building on each other's work.

Sure the benefits are great but don't compensate for low TC compared to the other major tech companies. Base salaries are far lower and stock refreshers are at a much smaller scale. - established massive company. Can be good, but in this case is a con. So many hoops to jump through and random people for approval so they feel involved. Always feels like it takes 10x longer to get anything done and out the door. People also seem to be indecisive.

If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher. 401k match is nice.3. Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine. This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs. The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either. You'll get a bonus each year and some stock. It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.",

Double that for vendors. It is VERY hard to stand out and move up in the company.

Lot's of top 5% talent has left, none of those folks stay around to wait for a Partner spot to open up, and you'll park for a long time at 66/67 unless you're in a high growth business.Zero adjustments to overall salary or comp package in about the last 8-9 years, though they did spot fixup some people with random stock bonuses a few years ago.Lot's of over leveled people crowding the Principal band in some teams, many of whom are garbage compared to the upcoming Seniors. You find more of this in the older products, lots of old dark corners to hide in, but it exists in some form on most teams.There are a fair number of teams that have grown too quickly that resulted in rampant overpromotion, whereas in other orgs even if you're great it can be difficult to level up to the high 60's because the biz moves so slowly. This has created significant unbalance in quality and competence at a given level across the company, so on one team your Principal GEM might be incredible but on another you have a completely incompetent Partner that somehow nobody is managing out.",

If you think the current projects is not aligning with your career aspirations, you can chose to move in the new one. Microsoft senior leadership in Microsoft office team allows for internal shuffle every two years.- IC and manager relationship is good and healthy (as per my experience)- 1 large scale hackathon every year in July, and 2 org level hackathons where people can invest 1 week in each hackathon to try with some of their own projects- Microsoft is so much customer and employee-centric company. They always care about their employee's physical, mental well being.- Microsoft India has a special group called as Garage which organizes different kinds of workshops, learning groups on topics such as: Robotics, Quantum Computing, AI/ML, IOT etc.- Stock value and image of Microsoft is good in financial market.",
			"cons": "- Overall career growth is slow. Unless your visibility is extremely high within your direct and sister team.- Poor compensation offered compared to competitive companies- You will see your value (monetary) value will decrease if you chose to stay in company for more than 2 years.- Senior leadership is good, but junior leadership (your Manager and skip level) is not that great. You can observe little politics their.- If you are in IDC (India) in a project that is lead by other sites such as Redmond (US), Japan, China, Israel, then you may feel like a vendor who is just helping them. You may not get good part of the projects which would actually help you in your technical growth. In that case politics is largely played at junior leadership level.- In some orgs promotion happens half yearly, so that's a drawback.- Microsoft is expanding like anything, they have now become mass hires like Infosys and TCS. The quality of hires and interview both has extremely degraded. So you might not feel special if you are hired OR you may see many not-so-good engineers around you.",

Everyone is cognizant of different lifestyles and other than meetings at certain times, is completely fine with you moving your working hours around the day (ex. some ppl do a few hours later in the evening and start much later). Many employees have families and a larger out-of-work life, so they themselves prioritize that more and it makes there be less pressure for others to prioritize work. Definitely A+ for that. Perks are really nice. ESPP, 401k match, perks+ (1200$ to use on whatever we want per year), can establish a really solid financial foundation early on in your career. Tons of resources to use (linkedin learning, library, etc) if you want to learn new stuff.",

It takes a while to get approval from all parties and there's little motivation to make a large change if what exists works (even if there are major flaws). Because of that, there might be a lot of tech debt in the team, which causes for the technical skills rot that a lot of other reviewers mention. But it's ultimately up to you if you want to keep your skills sharp or learn new things. If you don't really push for it, then management will be generally be perfectly happy with you twiddling your fingers with the same old tech. No one will be really forcing you to learn new stuff, which might be a plus or a con (con for me since I'm early in career). ",

Strong push back still for things not invented at Microsoft. People from Windows team permeates the company as a whole, and in my experience, even when smart, they tend to be narrow minded and have a culture of bullying and pushing back to get their way. Build system and coding practices are in line with what you would expect from 20-30 years ago. If you want to master how to abuse C/C++ macros, coupled spaghetti code, the latest fad on .NET (not compatible with the previous latest fad), passive-aggressive push-back techniques, and convoluted COM interfaces, this is the place to be! Elitist higher management. Some people (L68 and above I know) will literally not talk to you unless you are above certain level; the issue with this is that they are totally disconnected from what is going on, living in a little bubble of privilege and filtering out whatever they dislike. In many teams you can only grow if you suck up and/or be silent and comply. My experience is that many employees are lifers and play favorites. Many managers are in just to build their little empires. If you are in a team with a weak leadership chain and are a high achiever this plays against you, as they may see you as a threat, actively suppress you, and will promote mediocre and worse only.By the way, at a certain level you are competing with all your peers on the org on the same band, so there is stack ranking, and above L64 it becomes toxic and political very fast. Compensation does not depend on impact, you have to fight for every cent, and then only if you are about to leave team they will throw something at you. Most money is used to make L67+ happy. Paying a big bonus for a DE/Partner can screw refreshers for everybody under their leadership for the year regardless of what you manager promised you (hint: middle manager can only do some damage control, they are not really empowered in this).Training is a joke for a company this size. Professional growth is totally up to you, and next to nil for management. You get some random subscriptions and good luck. Mentorship is flaky at best.No proper CI/CD anywhere I have seen. Pushing a change, depending on the team can literally take hours or days (if there is a conflict). Testing is as bad or worse as code, and looked down by most devs. At the end, before releasing, all this causes an incredible amount of manual labor for the most trivial tasks. Oncall for some teams takes most of the team effort because of this.Promotions are political, so the above keeps compounding over time until (periodically) a reorg is needed, and some within management are moved around (of course, without any external consequence or visible accountability).

Managers have too much power in this organization and can easily slow down your career progression.People are usually not genuine, always come with interests, trying to put their names on deals for their own visibility, career aspirations.

In general the work life balance is good, although Azure seems usually busier. When I used to work in a non-Azure team, I even witnessed colleagues who can be a full-time software engineer and part-time real estate broker at the same time! I think the added bonus is if you are thinking of startup, but you still want some steady income at first, you can try to land in a rest and vest team within Microsoft, and only quit to full-time startup when it's mature.3. 401k match seems like one of the best industry offering.4. Although lots of people crave for FAANG tier companies, the reality is they can't even get an interview opportunities. Microsoft is a good step stone to polish your resume and open the door to FAANG, although the best case scenario is to stay at Microsoft for only one year, and then knock the door.",
			"cons": "1. To be fair, comp is ok, if considering all the tech companies (numerous startups included) across the country. However, the comp is not competitive in the tech talent places like Bay and Seattle. Companies like F/G can easily poach the candidates from Microsoft. What's even worse is senior leadership knows the comp issue, as well as benefits issue, but is not willing to fix it. Meanwhile companies like F/G provide free food, Microsoft just added 10% food prices by not subsidizing the sales tax last year. Search in the internal Yammer threads, you can find lots of frustrations on comp and benefits.2. Slow promo. Microsoft leveling is messed up, it basically divides each level into two sub-levels at least. This for sure will make promo slower. Also the slow process at Microsoft makes it even worse.3. Proprietary tech stack. To be fair, this is improving, especially in Azure. However you can still see lots of old-time Microsoft people are obsessed with Microsoft proprietary stack. The result is when they publicize the stack, it can be beaten brutally. Azure data lake gen1 was a good example.4. Too PM-centric. If you have to work with a TPM who's not from engineering background, good luck! It can be a real pain to work effectively. However it seems like a good number of TPMs are actually from Sales/marketing/MBA background!5. Easy to loss motives. If you are not strongly motivated, but you are concerned about your comp, you can easily trap yourself into a vicious cycle of wanting to leap forward, but you somehow lose last mile of momentum. I had good number of leet buddies in Microsoft, and we spent lots of quality time to study. But guess what, only I left so far.6. Talent drain with senior or below engineers. Couple years back, Microsoft can still easily poach candidates from Amazon for senior or below engineers. However ever since even Amazon ramped up on the industry hire comp, Microsoft just keeps lowering its posture. There's even one instance in Blind, where people choose Nordstrom over Microsoft!7. Senior software engineer title recognition problem. There's a general perception that Microsoft L63 does not usually map to senior at FAANG tier companies, although it usually depends on interview performance. Coupled with slow promo, it's almost wise to leave at the sweetspot levels, which is L60 and L62. Another wise spot is to leave within one year of new grad, since you can still be considered a new grad candidate for some companies like Google.8. At most a 4-year stop shop, if you care about TC. Microsoft also has the secret cult of insultingly low annual stock refresh. A quick blind search will make you realize, target stock refresh for L65 is ONLY 36k/5yr. Once you run out of on-hire cash and stock, your TC will cliff miserably, not even on par with your first year, even if you exclude on-hire cash. This is in stark contrast with F/G like companies, where  5th year TC is at least comparable to 1st year TC, if you don't count on-hire cash.",

			"desc": "Generally good work life balance, but it is team dependent. Comp is low, and the senior leadership is fake.",
			"pros": "Decent work life balance if you land in a non SaaS or PaaS team. Compensation is ok, and the medical plan is really good.401k match is excellent and there is an opportunity for higher contributions through backdoor Roth IRA.The campus is very nice and big, with new buildings coming soon.",
			"cons": "The senior leadership is very hypocritical and is only interested in PR stunts and not in fixing the root cause of issues (whether they are internal or external). Satya pretends to be a nice guy but in reality he is not very good at being empathetic towards Microsoft's employees. This trait seems to be common across the people on the board.Work life balance can easily get out of whack in teams which are part of SaaS or PaaS (e.g. Yammer, Azure, Outlook, etc.) with on-call rotations made difficult by the lack of engineers and too many buggy features.The constant request from clients to introduce new feature means tech debt is never address filling the code with bugs and making everyone's life more difficult. This is a sweatshop and pretty much a consulting business.Compensation is not competitive with Microsoft's main competitors, and in spite of the STL knowing about the comp issues, as people have been complaining about it yearly, they are refusing to address it.The talent is generally pretty mediocre, with a good number of engineers lacking basic knowledge about distributed systems, designing APIs and data encapsulation.",
