5,Comp & Culture! Top-quality.,"* Being surrounded by top talent in every sphere of the work — there is no room for dead weight or average performance. This also means there’s an endless wealth of learning opportunities at every level, and it’s not uncommon to find yourself having lunch with someone who you later learn is a leading global authority in their field.* Minimal bureaucracy, with highly agile and empowered teams across the board.* Hierarchy is far less material than most companies — colleagues at all levels of authority are typically eager to listen to and learn from others at different levels.","* At scale, many of the most desirable cultural aspects (high autonomy, agility, all-senior level staffing) will be / are fading as the company matures into a more traditional corporate atmosphere.* The best aspects of the culture are understood and applied variously across org’s — while autonomy, feedback, tech savvy, and top-of-market pay are all rigorously aligned, debated, and enforced in most of Engineering for example, their implementation in areas like Customer Service is poor by comparison and more closely mirrors banal, generic American companies.* Pressure to over-perform can be high, though mostly self inflicted. Most of Netflix is comprised of exceptionally high performers who naturally have high expectations for themselves. The scales of performance are not like other environments you may be used to, so it’s easy to be too self-critical or push yourself harder than is healthy or necessary. Take a break!* As corporatocracy continues to take hold of the famous (infamous?) Netflix culture of ‘No Rules, Rules’ and budget constraints become tangible for the first time, employees will have less leverage to self-advocate for personal growth and accomplishment, and role mobility is rapidly decreasing.","Verified User  Former Employee  s******  Senior DevOps Engineer - Apr 23, 2022 ","Following a reorganization, my team charter was diverted towards a less technical role trajectory that I had no interest in participating in.

","On the brink of the biggest change Netflix has ever been through as a company, introducing engineering levels. So far it seems like decisions are made in a vacuum by leadership and opportunities for feedback/dissent haven’t felt like they are there (hence the 3 stars in my review. I still love Netflix, but it feels like we are losing one of the major differentiators that has set Netflix apart from other companies over the years.

Insane micromanagement at each step, veiled as feedback. No training or documentation are in existence for any of their workflows. The little training I did receive was irrelevant to the day-to-day of my role. Forget trying to plan anything across projects because they don't work from timelines (my entire job).

","The company is large, so there is now room for less valuable employees to survive in the shadows for a long time without contributing anything.

5,Impact. Autonomy. Work with adults. PTO.,"Netfliix isn't for everybody. I've worked awhile in the Bay Area and a large majority of engineers would love to get a medium-level spec and build the best app to solution for it. Netflix asks its engineers to keep asking existential questions about what's needed next and how to keep scaling and its engineer/IC led. Yes you can get more comp elsewhere, but your peers are mature adults who can handle feedback and criticism. You get challenged with thoughtful questions. Yes, you may need to defend your solution and in the end, you get to build it and take responsibility for your decisions.I've rarely seen a director or manager get into the technical weeds and guide a project and tell people what they need to do. There's a lot of trust, but there's also a lot of expectation that you'll execute. Between Platform, Product, Studio, Data, and now Games, there are pockets of dysfunction, any company will have that. But as a whole, there's a lot of humanity and compassion. It's been the best place to work in my 20+ year career. A lot of smart people, a lot of cool challenges, and fricking unlimited PTO that people actually take. Heck, on LI people were bragging about the week their company gave them to recuperate from lockdowns. Netflix gave an entire month (slow August) and for the most part, we all did take a slow August... (Delta kept everyone from coming back in September but that was out of anyones control)Yes things are changing and it's becoming more big company-ish, but it's still a great place to be.","Reorgs.

The pay is amazing and if you ever feel underpaid, just interview and get an offer and it'll get beat.  The best part is, everyone acts like an adult here.  You do what you want and what you think is best for the company. If someone is doing a bad job, you give them feedback and let them know.  And if in the end you do get fired, you walk away with a huge check.","The streaming product org is very healthy, but I notice the health of the culture can vary from org to org.

5,Love working here but YMMV depending on team,"Netflix has a very different culture (yes, the memo is fairly accurate) which I actually like and it matches my values for the most part. There is no fire quick culture that I have seen; they are a bit more open about it but I have not noticed a hugely increased churn at the individual contributor level. Compensation is great and the recent COVID episode has shown that the company cares about their employees.","Your experience at Netflix is highly dependent on your team. Since there is a very strong emphasis on doing what is best for Netflix without explicitly defining what that is, each team will be slightly different. Unlike Google or Facebook where there is much more process which makes things a bit more similar, at Netflix you are more at the mercy of your manager which can make things bad for you id you have a crappy manager.There are also fewer things to work on than in a company like Google but if you find something interesting to do at Netflix, it is a great place. Finally, since there really isn't any level, career growth is more elusive to track. This is particularly true for ICs where there is no real defined growth path.
