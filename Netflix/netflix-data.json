Netflix asks its engineers to keep asking existential questions about what's needed next and how to keep scaling and its engineer/IC led. Yes you can get more comp elsewhere, but your peers are mature adults who can handle feedback and criticism. You get challenged with thoughtful questions. Yes, you may need to defend your solution and in the end, you get to build it and take responsibility for your decisions.I've rarely seen a director or manager get into the technical weeds and guide a project and tell people what they need to do. There's a lot of trust, but there's also a lot of expectation that you'll execute. Between Platform, Product, Studio, Data, and now Games, there are pockets of dysfunction, any company will have that. But as a whole, there's a lot of humanity and compassion. It's been the best place to work in my 20+ year career. A lot of smart people, a lot of cool challenges, and fricking unlimited PTO that people actually take. Heck, on LI people were bragging about the week their company gave them to recuperate from lockdowns. Netflix gave an entire month (slow August) and for the most part, we all did take a slow August...
