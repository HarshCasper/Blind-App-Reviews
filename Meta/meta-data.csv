It's possible to manage but there are roles where it's known that you'll sell your soul.Middle management is the most thankless job because you have unrealistic expectations from senior leaders while constantly managing the performance anxiety of your direct reports. Get ready for reorgs every 6-12 months. Performance ratings are a game of how you manage up, advocate/showcase your work and how your manager represents you in the room.We are losing top talent every day because we continue to tolerate toxic, manipulative, backstabbing and gaslighting behaviors from senior ICs and managers. There are teams which foster fear in their teams by scrutinizing every mistake, fail to provide any recognition or praise, and favor hierarchical structures over the described flatness and equitable organization structure. If you are able to ignore or be shielded by your manager from the above cons, you can thrive in your role. The people can be the best, but also be the worst if they're in it for themselves.

3,Join only for Comp and Perks,Compensation - Top of the market comp Perks - very good perksRemote friendly,"Poor Work life balance- Pip culture and performance review cycles scare the shit out of engineers. While the management publicly says that performance is based on the impact, they also look into number of lines of code written, number of code reviews performed, length of code review comments etc. This causes unnecessary anxiety among the engineers. To ensure that they are not in the bottom of the metrics, I have seen many engineers jump into code reviews, leave a comment and forget about it just to get their metrics up. I have also observed similar trends in submitting code as well where engineers just perform code mods to get their coding metrics up. Finally, you need to brag a lot about your work. Keep posting about your work in internal groups to broadcast your work. Most often, no one cares or reads these posts.Poor Management - Management doesn't clearly have an idea about where the company is heading next.
