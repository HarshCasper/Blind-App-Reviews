Get ready for reorgs every 6-12 months. Performance ratings are a game of how you manage up, advocate/showcase your work and how your manager represents you in the room.We are losing top talent every day because we continue to tolerate toxic, manipulative, backstabbing and gaslighting behaviors from senior ICs and managers. There are teams which foster fear in their teams by scrutinizing every mistake, fail to provide any recognition or praise, and favor hierarchical structures over the described flatness and equitable organization structure. If you are able to ignore or be shielded by your manager from the above cons, you can thrive in your role. The people can be the best, but also be the worst if they're in it for themselves. ",

Impact driven, anything not directly impactful, or not impactful in your manager's view is useless. Better Engineering and other tools to make Eng life better are not considered important at all. 3.

			"cons": "Be warned, the reality TV show maxim of I came here to win, not make friends should be the slogan of Facebook.I joined Facebook as an accomplished senior data scientist with over a decade of experience. I thought I'd seen it all and that this would be a good place to put my experience to work. Quickly, it became clear that I was on my own in a sink-or-swim position because of my seniority.Yes, there is a data science bootcamp, but it is so disjointed and abstract from my day-to-day work that I found it nearly useless. I would strongly caution people coming from a non-FAANG from joining at an IC5 level or higher. The expectations are incredibly high from the very beginning, so you will almost certainly need late nights and long hours to get enough done in your first year. This was not just my experience, but several other people I know who joined as IC5sIf you are the kind of person who values work-life balance... If that means to you an average 45 hr/wk or fewer, I would strongly caution you against Facebook. The compensation is incredibly alluring, but it will be difficult to hold to that desired hourly schedule on most of Facebook's product teams.So much of FB's corporate culture is determined by the PSC performance review process. I know they are changing it to be annual rather than semiannual, but I doubt that will have much impact. The important aspects of it are the SEVEN levels of performance; that upwards of HALF of your comp is determined by your review; and that your manager has little say over your rating, instead more heavily influenced by potentially anonymous reviews from your colleagues. Those who succeed at FB are the ones who are willing to claim credit wherever they can get it. Modesty is a cardinal sin for your career at FB. So, if you are uncomfortable claiming most of the credit for the impact of work that you contributed to within a team setting (I am), then please avoid FB for your mental health.If you are up for a more competitive, individualistic workplace, I really think FB is a good place for you.

They don't always downlevel you in the interview, assuming you gave all the right signals to the hiring committee (unlike Google they usually do)/.Benefits are great. 401K, Mega-door-able, 401K offers brokeragelink so you can invest 401k in individual stocks if you want, $4k baby cash, $3k child annual reimbursement allowance, $75 WFH monthly stipend, $3k for WFH setup, $720 annual wellness expense (you can even buy Switch fitness band!!!) etc. 2021 they gave us 3 extra fridays off on top of 2 FB Choice Days (formerly known as volunteering days). You get to accumulated up to (I think) 33 days of PTO every year.Work wise you definitely do get to work with a lot of amazing and talented people, from hardware to compiler and kernel devs. We built pretty much everything from the ground up in house, only a handful of external projects would use things like AWS/Terraform. The good thing is since almost everything you do at work is internally built, we generally have a better support for the tool.People do put a lot of thoughts into load testing, DR etc, at least from a company-wide exercise PoV. Every day there is at least one region undergoing a drain, a load test, or a complete storm (outage) testing.A lot of amazing internal tools like service discovery and continuous build are much easier to operate with than the traditional AWS cloud stuff.",
			"cons": "Overall, long hours. Now, you have to put in time and effort to make $$$, esp if you want to get Exceed or above. However, since each level has its own bar (expectations), if you don't deliver the right impacts, you can end up getting meet most (MM). Usually 2 meet mosts = pip, and most people don't make it. I am in this tough spot but I am planning to quit anyway.If you do get out of pip, either you have an extremely supportive manager, or you are lucky (actually both). Otherwise, if you ever into pip, you need to start look for a new job.So how the hell did i get into it? I came in with a high hope, and has been a hardworking IC. But my manager put me on the wrong team and I didn't deliver much. Then he placed me on a more mature team so I can be more effective. However, due to capacity and other dependency blocking, I did not deliver the migration 100% by the end of the half. The calibration committee didn't like that and think my impacts were light, despite I did a ton of other really good stuff in the other axis (like saving capacity etc).There is a ton of good tech debts worth solving, but they are not deem impactful from my level's expectation, so, FB didn't think it's worth getting meet all (MA).This happens to a lot of more senior people too. Our attrition rate is around 2 years. Now, there are a lot of people >=5 years still sticking around, so you may be lucky.However, if you prefer bottom-up  BUT want your manager to recongize your work and promote you based on the sum of work rather than the sum of impacts, then FB is not for you. If you like digging around every little stuff because they all seem matter in terms of reliability, FB is not for you.Mission wise - koolaid. I've been a long time user of FB, IG and WhatsApp. A lot of shit ideas being pushed out at the expense of user experience.Some teams would get diffs in at 11pm on friday despite being told no consistently in incident review.",

			"cons": "- Salary is low when compared on a Money per hour criteria- Free food is not there in the Post Covid eraNow I have written in the required structure, here comes my real review of FB:As a company FB suffers from a lot of problems. The first one is legacy code base. I mean the code repo is monolithic and the code is in multiple languages so you need to work on multiple languages at one time. This might sound exciting to some of you but honestly its not as you keep on trying to improve the infra or find infra bugs without really shipping out ML products which you love. This brings me to the second problem which is frameworks. Yes there are a lot of them. You might be a very experienced MLE well versed in all the tools on the market but you will just feel like a beginner once you land here. I mean you might believe that all the YOE you had is going to help but no it couldn't. There are just so many frameworks and code you would need to sort that you would take around 3-4 months minimum to get productve and once you get the hang of one framework. Surprise, there comes a new one and you start all over again. I mean a lot of infra teams just try to ship impact by creating new frameworks rather than improving the previous ones because the previous one has too many issues. Which brings me to my third point - PSC. Why were the frameworks not well built. Because FB works on the culture of continuous reviews and that means that you just need to work on impact and show it every six months. This makes you short-sighted and everyone on your team is looking for just solving short-term issues and making a post out of it. The more posts you make the better your rating would be. And thats not a good scenario to have when you are building products. People just keep on coming with really insane ideas that look pretty nice on the outside but really just add to the complexity of the products without adding the same amount of value. Yeah sorry for this big rant. But yeah not a good company for a fresher as well as they won't learn anything for a new job. For seniors you would start from scratch. The nly thing you would learn would be  people skills and there also how to do politics, maintain your image and just backstab your colleagues. You won't be able to make a friend in your immediate team if you try. That's about it I guess. ",

			"pros": "I've been at the FB Ads Data (Signals & Delivery) org for nearly 4yrs and have been promoted once from IC to people manager. I have a team of 5 & my org is called BPM Development. We're represent the voice of the customer, do market research & go-to-market strategy for product management. Overall it has been a good experience where I've learnt things at a scale & impact that you can experience at very few tech companies. Pros- (Needless to say) FB has the best benefits ever. You're really well looked after as an employee even in non-eng, non-product roles- Leadership is super transparent. For instance MZ does weekly company wide Q&As and is surprisingly open to answering all types of challenging Qs- The Ads org leadership has a LOT of clout and power (read resources & authority) as is to be expected from the 2nd largest ad platform - Leadership is genuinely trying to do the right thing (even though they sick at positioning it well to the outside world at most times)",
			"cons": "- It's a very Darwinian culture (I.e. survival of the fittest or the most  impactful  in this case). So if you're in an area that's a company priority you can work hard & shine (read: quick promos, accolades etc). But you can work equally hard in an area that not the hot topic of the half & no one gives a shit- Career growth is very subjective in non PM & non Eng roles. It's about who you please not what you deliver. Mainly because you do need to force a curve even though  official  line is we reward impact. So with a team of A players, you just raise the bar & the top performer you  like  the least gets dinged.- As a ppl manager there's a lot of subtle pressure to  bring your whole self  to work but still be politically correct. For e.g. it's ok to express you're appalled by Mark's decision to not ban Trump's account, verbally in a meeting. But you can't post that on your wall as a manager as it sets the  wrong  example. So  be open  but only in a closed room.- there's barely any product development momentum in the Ads org compared to 3yrs ago, due to the convoluted (& ineffective IMO) Privacy reviews & resulting  fear  of how the media might react.",

No one gets rewarded for maintenance so work is constantly throw-away and/or taken for granted. XFN is hit or miss and often opinionated w/o due diligence. Culture rewards the first-movers and doesn't consider wreckage left behind. It's a race to show impact, and it's far more important that people know about your work than your work being valuable. Leads to more and more name dropping despite discouragement from the folks being dropped.Work/Life is odd... leaders blur the line themselves unintentionally and undermine the message of  take your PTO . Half your time is spent  getting alignment , not much left to grow technically in your role. Also the proprietary stack makes it more difficult to translate skills outside the ecosystem. ",

Employees forced to write self-reviews every 3 months to tell manager what they've been working on.- working more hours than an average job - having access to so much also means being massively overwhelmed by amount of information, project/team updates - hard to focus, too many notifications/meetings/chats/bots trying to grab your attention while coding- projects often feel disorganised as projects are small and a lot of engineers don't have experience leading projects. - prioritisation important as you'll be in charge of your own work and need to manage and push forward multiple work-streams yourself.- with managers and reports moving around so much (due to flexibility or frequent re-orgs), team identity and feeling of being in a team is often non-existent or feels contrived- managers have too many reports and can't give a lot of attention. 1:1 meetings will be for them to catch up on your work more than it is for them to build relationships or care about WLB, team relationships. - not enough focus on code quality within teams, a lot of code quality is delegated to other teams who make changes across multiple teams. While it's easy to make changes to code quality, you won't have time or be able to prioritise it as it's not rewarded enough- product development over-relies on data-driven (experimentation) approach rather than UX, UXR design.",

			"cons": "I have had 7 managers within less than 3.5 years, this is partly due to the groups growing, expanding, my project moving around to different organizations.In general, there is too much focus on short term impact (6 months) at the company, this creates an  incentive for people not to work toward unifying architecture or coordinating complex but critical scale and long term improvements.  They do have a big bet program for these types of projects, however my experience was partners and customers were still hesitant to commit unless you can show significant half over half impact for them.  The result is that it takes much longer and is more difficult navigating and keeping many of these big bets alive.  I've also seen, even within the same group, the legacy team and the new big bet team compete on features and customers, making it ever more unlikely that customers would make the investment necessary to move to the new system.There's a tendency to go along with un-optimal and even downright poor decisions in an effort to appear collaborative and avoid friction with others.  In my team, there was a notoriously difficult person who was essentially given a free pass by our manager because he had some necessary skills for the project.  This created an atmosphere where people did not enjoy working on the team and they eventually recruited more junior 'yes' folks to surround the difficult person.  Unfortunately, the project overall ends up suffering, other senior folks don't want to work on the team, it starts misses it's deliverables (since the difficult person has no idea how to estimate anything), keeps making poor decisions requiring rewriting all the code, etc.",

Very collaborative, great people, and I am learning so much every single day. Both teams had these cons in common:Work-life balance is sometimes a challenge. There is an over-emphasis on shipping new things, rather than fixing and expanding on what's been shipped already. Things are hectic. You never feel like you can relax, there is always so much happening that if you coast for more than 1-2 days, you fall way behind. That's amazing for growth, but can also burn you out after a while. You always feel a little off-balance, like you don't know if you're doing well or not. The overall high intelligence leads to frequent debates over tiny things. That can be good if you know how to manage such conversations, but many people don't.It really takes all of your attention and energy to do well here, but if you're willing to put that in, are more on the extroverted side and can see and create new opportunities for yourself, this is an amazing place. It's like they throw you into a big garage full of tools and money, and tell you OK build something that will move this company forward and they give you a lot of leeway to do so.",
