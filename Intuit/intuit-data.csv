Some of them draw boxes and play politics about capabilities map and what belongs where and to which box instead of solving real problems or removing obstacles.- The promo process could be crappy sometimes. If you get rejected, very often the feedback and reasoning is unclear, so there's nothing really to do about that. The bar raisers (people who challenge promotion recommendations) and/or assessors are sometimes ridiculous. It feels like it's better to move elsewhere and then return at higher levels.

4.0,Depends on the team,"Awesome WLB & culture, everyone I work with brings themselves to work. Benefits are great, and working for a recognizable brand that helps people manage their small business or taxes (or both) feels good. Company values are great and so is the CEO. This is not an ageist company and that's rare. Execs seem to really care about diversity and culture. I like working here but there are risks. See cons. ","Managers with pulse scores below 60 are somehow still in leadership roles. Base comp is not competitive and TC relies on a volatile market. The tech debt is embarrassing, many have worked here 15+ years and are resting and vesting.  They've lost touch with modern technology. People without expertise in modern tech have too much power to say yes and no to innovations or recommendations they barely understand. Intuit seems to prioritize a rest & vest mentality over true innovation. If you want to be challenged by working at an innovative technology company, Intuit is probably not for you. Working here can be considered risky if you want to grow modern or futuristic skills. The pro is basic work will be dubbed innovative. But the con is never qualifying for a job at any other technology company. Intuit continues to elevate leaders who lack vision or skills for the future. The opposite of career growth but great if you are looking for a rest and vest lifestyle. There's a lot of benefit to that lifestyle unless you want a career outside of Intuit.

Not only is the base pay low, but it gets absurdly low vs the market for more senior roles. RSU refreshes are embarrassing, Sr. SWEs get 40k (over 4 years!!) refreshes, unless you're constantly exceeding expectations, which requires you violate your WLB (and even then, exceeds rating refreshes are much worse than everywhere else). Vesting schedule puts heavy emphasis on once per year vests on July vest date and refreshes do not start vesting for one year.- WLB: Intuit stakes a lot of their reputation on WLB, and to be honest its not THAT good. **It's not bad**, but it is really nothing special.- Work: The products are super boring and unexciting.

5.0,Loving it at Modern SaaS team.,"To all who are wondering if Intuit is a good place to work, here is my take.I am from Modern SaaS team.My work mostly revolves around Kubernetes, AWS and Golang.What I love most about working at Intuit?0) We don't get assigned work but we choose what to work on -the tickets/projects etc. This independence excites me and makes me responsible to deliver quality work.1) The work culture is great as everyone is encouraged to speak up / against a topic. I have seen a lot of passionate debates which just shows how much people care about the quality of the deliverables.2) Periodic design discussions and demos are great platform to validate our concepts and get expert advice. Both Management and Top Engineers attend these meetings.3) Internal hackathons - apart from getting great perks/swags during this week, we have freedom to experiment and work on any wild topic. We even have white space days every two weeks which is strictly reserved to work on side projects. Some great projects have come out of these and for the same reason management encourages with having no meetings for the day.3) I wouldn't go into the details of benefits as it's easily accessible on careers page. Highlights- fitness credits(1000$ per annum), live workout sessions, furniture setup for WFH, ESPP, get cool gadgets - iPhone, iPad. We get swags every now and then to celebrate the milestones.In sum: not here to debate if Intuit is a great place but I see a lot of negative reviews and I was perplexed while choosing Intuit over my other offers.

1.0,"stay away from it, management sucks","compensationsalarymost of the people don't have workmost of the work will be done by offrole employees, so they will work and onrole employees can relabel their work on their name, so you don't have to work and you will get spot bonus for that as well","Management sucks so did intuit's futureThere is no job security until you are one of the asslickersCompany and team culture sucks whichever team you are inFake GPTW survey resultsSilos everywhereEvery year they fire 10% of employees for no reason just to hire new 10%, so if you can avoid intuit, just avoid intuit","Verified User Current Employee  q*****  Senior Software Engineer - Aug 6, 2020",
5.0,"Very ethical company, great WLB, but feels larger and more bureaucratic than it should be","Everyone is very supportive and friendly.  It almost feels like a big family.  Every meeting includes people thanking one another and recognizing positive progress, even in stressful situations.  It was a bit weird at first, but now it seems natural and makes me realize how much other companies lack compassion or appreciation for their employees.New software efforts are quite good - everything is on AWS (no data centers at all), and the company uses tools like Github, Splunk, Google docs, etc. Kotlin and similar languages are growing in use.  But there are pockets of legacy monoliths like you would expect from a 35+ year old company.  Make sure to ask what team and codebase you'll be working in to avoid being stuck in legacy hell.Benefits are great compared to other tech companies based on my experience.  Nice perks like $1000/year to spend on fitness, low medical copays, more weeks of vacation, personal days off for volunteering, etc. Intuit takes pride in trying to take care of its employees.","Everything is done via meetings.  Everything.  Even the most trivial decisions require getting everyone together.  Easily 2-3x the number of meetings vs other places I've worked. All decisions are alignment-driven and there is constant confusion as to who the approver actually is.Most engineers are quite good, but there seems to be a higher % of lower performers vs Amazon/Google/etc from what I can tell. It's not crazy, but it can lead to stagnation especially on core teams, since there's not the same up or out philosophy.  Then again, it feels way less cutthroat vs other Amazon/Google/Facebook comments that I see on Blind.","Verified User Current Employee  M********  Director of Software Development - Aug 6, 2020",

4.0,Inspiring mission and care for employees,"Intuit puts a high priority on integrity. I was skeptical about that at first (what corporation truly does these days?), but after being here for a year, I can say they really try to live up to this. The company is not perfect, but it really prioritizes doing right both for its customers and employees. People are generally very supportive and collaborative. There's a strong culture of recognizing that people have lives outside of work that are important to them.","There's a lot of chaos in the day-to-day operations and internal technology is shockingly behind where you might expect.

3.0,Depends on manager,"Company has very progressive work policies and a generally good environment. The company offers a 401k (vests after two years), transportation subsidies, and bonus pay for meeting survey metrics.","Theres little accountability on the managers who control the experience. If the managers decide to be obsessed with the surveys, they can make your time at the job terrible. The pay is low as well, lowering the incentive of top quality talent to enter or stay. Surveys are pushed very hard overall, which takes away focus from serving the customers and more towards meeting the numbers'.","Verified User Current Employee  s*******  Customer Support Representative - Jun 16, 2020",
