Intuit seems to prioritize a rest & vest mentality over true innovation. If you want to be challenged by working at an innovative technology company, Intuit is probably not for you. Working here can be considered risky if you want to grow modern or futuristic skills. The pro is basic work will be dubbed innovative. But the con is never qualifying for a job at any other technology company. Intuit continues to elevate leaders who lack vision or skills for the future. The opposite of career growth but great if you are looking for a rest and vest lifestyle. There's a lot of benefit to that lifestyle unless you want a career outside of Intuit. ",

Love the hybrid workplace approach, which lets employees enjoy the best of both worlds - flexibility of WFH but collaboration and engagement with team onsite. Plus a beautiful campus, and the stock price growth is not bad at all!The work itself is challenging - this is a high performance culture and you are surrounded by some of the smartest people who have a lot of passion for their work. The mission is something that is easy to get behind and doesn't make you feel icky, vs working for other companies where your product exists to sell more ads. The values of the organization also shine through - from its commitment to diversity and inclusion, to giving back to the community, to commitment to sustainability - it feels good to work for this company.",

I applaud that they are listening to employees and trying to solve for this pain point. There is still room for improvement in removing barriers to workload. Intuit is a big company and sometimes still acts like an old financial company. There's a lot of red tape, politicking, and gatekeeping of some work sometimes that can be very frustrating. ",

I have seen a lot of passionate debates which just shows how much people care about the quality of the deliverables.2) Periodic design discussions and demos are great platform to validate our concepts and get expert advice. Both Management and Top Engineers attend these meetings.3) Internal hackathons - apart from getting great perks/swags during this week, we have freedom to experiment and work on any wild topic. We even have white space days every two weeks which is strictly reserved to work on side projects. Some great projects have come out of these and for the same reason management encourages with having no meetings for the day.3) I wouldn't go into the details of benefits as it's easily accessible on careers page. Highlights- fitness credits(1000$ per annum), live workout sessions, furniture setup for WFH, ESPP, get cool gadgets - iPhone, iPad. We get swags every now and then to celebrate the milestones.In sum: not here to debate if Intuit is a great place but I see a lot of negative reviews and I was perplexed while choosing Intuit over my other offers.

			"pros": "Everyone is very supportive and friendly.  It almost feels like a big family.  Every meeting includes people thanking one another and recognizing positive progress, even in stressful situations.  It was a bit weird at first, but now it seems natural and makes me realize how much other companies lack compassion or appreciation for their employees.New software efforts are quite good - everything is on AWS (no data centers at all), and the company uses tools like Github, Splunk, Google docs, etc. Kotlin and similar languages are growing in use.  But there are pockets of legacy monoliths like you would expect from a 35+ year old company.  Make sure to ask what team and codebase you'll be working in to avoid being stuck in legacy hell.Benefits are great compared to other tech companies based on my experience.  Nice perks like $1000/year to spend on fitness, low medical copays, more weeks of vacation, personal days off for volunteering, etc. Intuit takes pride in trying to take care of its employees.",
			"cons": "Everything is done via meetings.  Everything.  Even the most trivial decisions require getting everyone together.  Easily 2-3x the number of meetings vs other places I've worked. All decisions are alignment-driven and there is constant confusion as to who the approver actually is.Most engineers are quite good, but there seems to be a higher % of lower performers vs Amazon/Google/etc from what I can tell. It's not crazy, but it can lead to stagnation especially on core teams, since there's not the same up or out philosophy.  Then again, it feels way less cutthroat vs other Amazon/Google/Facebook comments that I see on Blind.",
