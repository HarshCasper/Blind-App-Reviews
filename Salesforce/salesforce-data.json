Employees who do move up through the company are the best at self promoting on internal company channels. Company cheerleading and having a high profile will get you much further than over performing on projects and utilization targets.Promotion cases are confrontational and there's very little real support for developing employees for future positions. Internal development tools exist but don't offer any real opportunity to develop new and advanced skill sets. Be ready to do that on your own time and budget. Pay and yearly raises are very low for the industry, 2-3% annually against consecutive multi-billion dollar quarters and best-years-ever.

Only the top 5% or so of employees in the solution engineering organization below a director or senior director level receive RSUs after being hired.  The budget for pay increases is 5% on most years and there is no separate budget for promotions.  As a result, they have to rob one person to pay someone else more than 5%.  Management will make you jump through a ton of hoops for the promotion and then congratulate you with an 8% raise.Like many companies, people quit due to being underpaid and then they replace you with external hires at the OTE you got somewhere else.",

That's why I gave career growth 4 stars. Gave management 4 stars as it was hard for some teams to have a good roadmap / ownership. And there was a lot of shuffling of teams and changing directions.

RSU refreshers is something every competitive company gives out to retain employees but Salesforce will never give that. Again, veering towards favoritism, if you know people, you'll be handed a payment for your services. Employees Success are more like event planners and less towards the success of an employee. Very outdated tech stack and the core tech on which Salesforce is built will soon go bust because it cannot anymore work on scale.

The tech division's culture is dominated by PM. PM org is incentivized to work against each other and never fix anything. They're rewarded for keeping their teams in a constant churn of vaporware for internal presentations and a shot at Dreamforce. UX is just for making my slides look good at the very last minute. Work-life balance at this company isn't for designers. You get squeezed between your PM and devs coasting. You're the only one stuck working. But none of your work will ship. UX management is too scared of losing a seat at the table with PM to ever say no to requests, no matter how unreasonable. Career progression is also a joke. Higher IC promotions have a long line.

The CI system is terrible and follows almost no modern best practices. Almost no tests are run before code is integrated, so unless you straight up break the build your code will probably go through, even if it breaks the most basic functionality. If you do break something, and it wasn't big enough for the entire company to notice, you probably won't find out for a couple of weeks as the test failures sit unnoticed on some obscure team's queue to be triaged. When you do break tests, 99% of the time it'll be selenium since no one seems to trust unit tests.There's absolutely no effort to improve developer productivity, so many tasks require tediously updating dozens of files, used by every team across the entire company, all of which are updated multiple times a day making delivering your code a race. Even the most commonly repeated tasks are not automated, and rarely can you even find documentation on what to do, so it's ripe for making mistakes that can take hours or even days to fix. It's not all uncommon for someone's status to be trying to fix my busted build. Since working on core is such a shitshow there's very little innovation. Many projects are incremental in nature, but the ones that aren't are always at risk for defunding since the company has chosen that it'll just acquire its future growth. This combined with near-constant reorgs makes it very difficult to grow your career since you feel like you get so little done.Engineers are rewarded for shoving shit out the door instead of delivering maintainable incremental solutions, so cowboy coders seem to rise while the more methodical engineers are left behind to clean up the mess when it inevitably breaks something for our customers.
