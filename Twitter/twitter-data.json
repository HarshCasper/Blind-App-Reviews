Product management is very naive and a lot of projects get priority without seeming to have any plan for impact. A lot of people say they put up with this because Twitter has good work life balance but that has not been my experience. There are a lot of fire drills, a lot of chores for different company processes, and the permanent remote situation has not been managed well leading to a lot of meeting coordination problems and poor Slack-based workflows full of constant pings.If you can manage to get huge total comp (so that you feel protected against stock declining) then Twitter is OK.

There's no standardisation in processes, designs, equipment, etc. Money is thrown out of the window with very weak designs and assumptions. Complete shit show.- Tools are creepy (when they exist) and the overall culture is to do (and redo) manual process, again and again...- In general the teams are not open to new ideas nor to collaborate effectively to any common goals. The company's culture is more concerned about soft topics (e.g., how do you identify yourself?) rather than evolving the business or rethinking its purpose.
