How does your insurance get worse every single year?- Insistence on coming to office in the middle of Covid. If you can't raise your TC by at least 50%, it's not enough for someone to waste  time commuting to your dull and boring office. You don't even do lunch under the guise that otherwise people won't support local businesses. That's some elitist crap.- Some crappy immigration policy. Oh, we can't let your travel outside the country for more than 14 days despite the fact that you haven't seen your family for two years and despite the fact that your manager is okay with it. Insisting people on paying attorney and GC immigration fees despite the fact that they are never getting a GC. Makes sense for people who leave the office before 2 years of getting the GC, but for others - it's just exploitative.- Work is absolutely crappy. The only real work is to prevent a Terminal outage. That is it. Anything else you do is actually pointless and tangential to business needs.- A ton of people have bounced ship during the pandemic. What would their response be - increase TC and let people work from home? Nope! Some silly elitist crap like - What if we give them more opportunities to wake up at 4 am on a Saturday to serve the homeless. Wouldn't that just help us fight the attrition? Gimme a break. If you paid people better and let them save time commuting, they can do those things by themselves - don't need to be doing that just to purport in ego exercises for a billionaire.",

			"cons": "Bloomberg is totally flat; no room to move up in established teams. Some pockets of talent, and a lot of lifers who are too afraid to go anywhere else after drinking the kool-aid for way too long. Tech stack is outdated, we're years behind other companies and we're famous for huge amounts of legacy code. Things move way too slow. At this rate we won't be able to catch up. Not really much upside, everyone that wants to be a customer already is, and faster moving competitors are snapping up real estate in a way that Bloomberg can't really compete with. I'm an IC, and comp is nothing to brag about. My bosses's boss is the CTO, so not really much of an opportunity for me to move up, as everyone above me has been here 20+ years and likely wont retire for 20 years. That's more or less the story for all ICs unless you get really lucky on a new team. The culture sucks. It's a mix of the worst parts of big sell side banking culture, and really the worst parts of tech culture. People outside of engineering are often times financial industry washouts that hold the company back. Get ready for dealing with business managers that are borderline computer illiterate, and have no understanding of how software development works.   Engineering management are normally good, but fall way short of inspirational. Mike has overstayed his usefulness by a long shot. Things were better when he was mayor and didn't interfere with progress. Unless you found yourself attending one of his rallies when he ran for president (hint: you didn't and not many people did) you probably won't like working for a megalomaniac with a Napoleon complex. Don't let them sell you on his 'philanthropy' either. It's all a thinly veiled tax-avoidance strategy that benefits his crony billionaire friends and self-severing political interests. If he really cared about the environment he wouldn't have a fleet of private aircraft and houses all over the world. Honestly, not a bad place if you're bottom tier talent looking to pad your resume at the expense of actually learning new tech, but if you have another offer, I'd consider it. ",
