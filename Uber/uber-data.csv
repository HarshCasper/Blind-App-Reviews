Don't fall for this.","- Toxic. Toxic. Toxic. I dont even know where to start. e.g. --> Aggresive culture: My TL threw his keys at me in a meeting when I couldnt meet a deadline after pushing diffs at 4am and working weekends for monfhs on end to meet a deadline my pushbacks were never taken seriously for. He would stare and grunt at me in meetings if I spoke too much and stole any attention.--> Toe-stepping still encouraged. People will tell you you're leading a project only to secretly create their own project plans and get your project cancelled.--> Ugly politics. People will lie to manuever their way into the right political alliances. Both your teammates and your manager.- The company doesnt care about you. You will realize this on your first day. It's in the air. I made 4 friends during onboarding - 2 of them voluntarily left within 2 months and 1 of them got laid off. - Frontline management is a joke.The company gives them almost no power or no knowledge of whats really happening. Attrition is ridiculous (my manager, skip and his skip all left in my first 7 months). Technical orgs often get managers from product orgs who just simply lack the technical vision to get teams to work together. When manager changes, you basically start proving yourself all over again in your current level. Note: I learnt a lot in my time at the company and met some very great engineers I will always stay in touch with.
