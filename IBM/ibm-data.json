I'm not working nights or weekends so that's great, and I sign off at a decent hour.Company Culture: People are nice, friendly, and are absolutely willing to help if you have questions (some people you learn to not bother so much, but that's with any company). There are Slack channels for your interests. Career Growth is meh. There are plenty of opportunities to learn and strengthen your skills.",
			"cons": "It's definitely a stepping stone sort of place for entry-level hires. I can see why many leave after 2 years at least or 4 years at most. (If you feel like you're not learning anything after 1-2 years, leave. Years of experience mean little if you don't have any projects or skills to show for it.)Compensation: it's a good starting point for entry-level positions, but compensation can take a long time to grow with you if you're planning to stay for 3-5+ years.  Company Culture: Teams/Departments tend to be siloed. If you're someone that values more personal project hand-offs, who likes to get to know their colleagues a little bit, it's achievable to do that but the environment can get a bit solitary and echo-ey at times.Career Growth: while *learning* opportunities are available and in decent amounts, being promoted into higher-level positions or getting promoted into having a higher salary, is actually quite difficult to achieve. It's dismal. I've met individuals who have been with IBM for 2 decades and only are just beginning to break into higher-level positions.Lay-offs are prevalent at times. It's not uncommon to have a lay-off season. In a similar vein, there's a significant turnover rate. (again, that depends on your department). Someone on the team may decide to leave within the year or just after a year of your arrival, thus increasing the workload for some people, which causes them to leave because the workload is too much, which puts more work onto more people and they leave, and that puts more work... you get the idea.

Too much middle management, trying to do too many things at once, and the more than occasional short-sighted decisions make it challenging to defend being there. Combine that with meager annual increases and benefits that get expensive quickly when you have more than one child to cover, and the cons start to loom. Other times, like when I hear news about the 100-qubit quantum computer just released, and see proactive, progressive policies for equality of all kinds, a clear and firm code of ethics, and active encouragement for reporting of unfair/unequal/unethical behavior, I'm proud to be an IBMer.

Aligning yourself to the right teams will be critical to your success at this company. Additionally while the company is restructuring (at a massive scale) to help eliminate silos, it'll be interesting how the culture evolves with a smaller marketing workforce. Historically, team goals have been largely unaligned to other adjacent teams, making it challenging to achieve business outcomes. However, if goals are more aligned given the unification of teams across marketing, then the company could potentially make a lot of progress on business outcomes in the future. Remains to be seen.

Trick is, keep moving them (people who are not part of the gang) to other managers, so one manager promises, by the time you are eligible, you are moved to another, he says, I can't promote you, I don't you, the cycle continues. the Middle management socks, they never keep their promises.

The training talks about honesty, true leadership, keeping up the promise, morality, but, most of middle management does not follow especially when it comes to recognizing the good work, though end client recognizes and promotion is only for people  who are part of the gang. Recently (may be last 3 years), if you are between projects, they assign you to bench managers, they literally harass you. You have find your own project with your connections, there are no recruiters anymore. Their Public sector/Federal practice is nothing but mafia gang, good old boys/girls syste. The APs and Partners does not hire IBM FTEs on project, though you are highly qualified first preference given to contractors who they know, IBM federal projects are practically run by contractors may be APs and Partners may have under the table dealing exists hence most contractors are working on IBM projects for 12 to 15 years, they can hire them as FTE, but APs and Parters, never high them and keep them contractors.

Very helpful in building skills.- Excellent 401k plan. This is one of the the best 401k plans among tech companies I've seen for investment geeks who value the advantages of tax-advantaged investment accounts.  - Match up to 6% of the base (by contributing 5% of your base). This is further enhanced due to the fact that IBM doesn't generally award bonus --- the base is usually 20% higher than other big corps in the area. This results in more company match than Google (also arguably the best 401k plan) if you contribute no less than 5% of your base for mid-level positions.  - Employees can contribute to 10% after-tax.  - The investment choices are well structured. All core investments for a basic portfolio are available at low cost, plus many low-cost extended choices, such as Dimensional Fund Advisor (DFA) funds.",
			"cons": "- Total compensation is generally not as good as other big corps.- Company work pace is slow. The good aspect is that everyone is slow, the bad aspect is that... everything you request others is slow as well.- The pace is slow, again. This means that career growth may be more difficult than elsewhere. If you need to learn from work, this is not a good place. But if you are confident in your skills and can manage to do some influential side projects, this can be turned to an advantage (Company projects, which are often shitty, won't bother you too much).",

All they care about is prioritizing marketable features even if it costs project foundation and maintainability. Once the sale gets made, they no longer care. IBM doesn't have any net-new customers. They rely on selling new products to old customers who have been locked in.Constant layoffs that are randomized by an HR RNG. I've seen great top-performers laid off quarter after quarter and there is no effort to retain top talent. This is very concerning and you never feel safe, no matter how much you're deemed as a necessity.",
