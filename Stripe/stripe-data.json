Problem: you can't do well in your role unless you do other peoples jobs because so many things critical to succeeding are broken-They promise the world when you get hired. Top performers get equity bonuses. This is why you don't need a 4 year RSU. Reality check: everyone gets average rating, including top performers. In your first year, managers are told not to give you a rating above SME so you end up not getting any comp raises for at least your first 2 years at the company-Sales is not valued or respected at this place. Our senior sales leaders are just waiting to cash out on their equity and don't care about people.

It's creating more equitable opportunity. That just feels good. And their business model is transparent and is such that when our customers do well, we do well.",
			"cons": "Here's what I'm noticing as trouble spots so far:- The new equity model caps potential for more recent hires. My advice: don't come here if you're just in it for stock.- Lack of mature planning, processes, and ops practices. Everyone is very focused on what's right in front of them and not so much the long term, strategic plan. It's hard to get things done because processes and roles/responsibilities across teams and individual people are undefined or unclear. My advice: unless you enjoy building these things and bringing the structure and clarity, now probably isn't the right time to join.- The writing culture seems to be some strange identity trait the company is desperately holding on to (for internal communications). The writing style is very specific with very few resources to teach you how to get it right and it slows you WAY down. The claim is that documenting helps others learn but materials are all over the place, outdated, and so long your eyes glaze over before you can even finish. It almost feels like people write long docs just for the sake of doing it.- We're hiring quickly and it's changing the culture. Those that have been here for awhile are holding on to the way it used to be and upset by the eroding culture. New people are struggling to understand and get integrated into the culture. To me the culture doesn't feel strong at all but I was told that will get better with time.- The resources and focus on I&D work feels wildly lacking and removed from the focus of the company. It's creating a bit of culture shock from my experience at previous companies and it pretty disappointing. That being said, it doesn't mean there isn't space for individuals to make a difference and the people are welcoming and inclusive so far.",

Some teams end up churning through 3-4 managers a year, all with varied visions and ideas. This causes major projects to be abandoned, and constantly juggling varying priorities. There are lots of great teams and managers at Stripe, but if you're unfortunate to land on a team that's going through large re-organizations that's had high manager attrition, expect a bit of turmoil. - Work Life Balance: Be prepared to always be online. You'll be working across time zones with multiple different team cohorts, and if you're not online when they are, you'll be behind the next day or projects will take major direction changes.- Lack of career progression: There's a lot of growth happening at Stripe, and that's no secret. Hiring doesn't seem to be internally sourced for upward roles, and being a top performer who brings smart ideas doesn't guarantee career progression.",
