5.0,Great onboarding experience as a new grad SWE,"I joined Adobe DX, and my team and manager has been amazing. My manager is very easy going and does not micromanage. My onboarding mentor is a senior engineer on the same team that has strived to help me learn as much as possible and let me contribute to anything as soon as possible. I'm encouraged to voice my opinion and thoughts even though I'm the most junior and youngest member of the team by 10 years. Everyone is very nice and patient, and the work environment is as far from toxic as possible. Work life balance is wonderful since basically all of my coworkers and manager have families. I'm not expected to work more than 40 hours and definitely not on weekends. Actually, if I work more than 40 hours, I'm technically entitled to overtime pay. My team is very chill, and the work and deadlines are not stressful at all. I love it here! Bonuses and benefits to join Adobe were great, ~25k before taxes. $10k sign on bonus, $5k relocation lump sum, $10k Learning Fund reimbursement. ","Not sure how recent Adobe's policy on this is, but apparently new employees join Adobe as hourly, not salaried, and this continues until either a promotion or one year has passed after start date. So yes, I am an hourly employee. This means I have to fill out a time card and log my working hours every week. I have to accumulate PTO, since only salaried get unlimited PTO. Plus, I have to use my PTO for non-holidays during the company shutdown periods (for example, company shutdown in July is July 5-9, but only July 5 and 6 are classified as paid holidays, so I have to use PTO for July 7-9). This basically means I have no PTO for vacations outside of company shutdowns for the first year at Adobe.I expect to be promoted to SWE II within a year, but after that, I think my career growth at Adobe may be limited or slower than I would like. My team doesn't really work on mission-critical stuff, which is why it's so chill and deadlines aren't really strict, but that also means promotions may be slower. Also, my team is very small, and in fact I am the only junior SWE on the team. ","Verified UserCurrent Employee  S*****  Software Development Engineer I - Jun 19, 2021",

3.0,"Large, older company with consensus-driven culture","Generally great work-life balance. With our globally distributed teams sometimes you have to flex but when people have personal commitments (family needs, personal appts, etc.) nobody questions it or thinks twice about it. PTO is unlimited and people actually use it. Sabbaticals every 5 years. I've found Adobe's efforts around diversity and inclusion to be genuine. Not perfect but there's strong commitment - both formal and informal structure within the company - to keep working at it. I've observed and experienced continuous work to listen to and learn from employees and shift course when needed.Stability through pandemic. A lot of proactive resources offered, including programmed days off since people were taking less PTO and getting burned out. Adobe's always been strong at focusing on employee experience and wellness.Really good people. Smart, talented, fun and interesting to be around. I've learned a lot from colleagues at Adobe and hope to stay connected with many of these folks for life.","Many teams and projects operate chaotically. After working directly with so many good, talented individuals at Adobe, I've come to believe it must be something structural about the way Adobe operates. It can't possibly be that so many awesome individuals (and smaller high functioning/high potential teams) are just individually screwing up. Strategic leadership feels like a gap. Prioritization and decision making process feel broken - it's a consensus-driven culture where roles and accountability are often unclear.I work in the creative cloud business and it still operates as if we ship boxed software. Big push for one or two major deadlines per year with lengthy executive review cycles to make decisions.Some combination of all these factors (maybe more) seems to hamper innovation and our ability to shift a collection of high potential people to solid high functioning teams. It happens, but seems to require people who can self-organize to work under the radar, or the occasional leader who can create air cover to 1) cultivate a high functioning team and 2) let them to do their thing without so much noise from the rest of the company.","Verified UserCurrent Employee  V*****  Product Manager - Apr 27, 2021",
