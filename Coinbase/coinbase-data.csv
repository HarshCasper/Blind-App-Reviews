2,Tough culture,- Good compensation- Good industry- Interesting projects- Good CEO,"This place will work you to the bone and come performance review time tell you you are ok.60 hour weeks are pretty normal. If you are a hard-working engineer like I am then this won't discourage you. However, the lack of acknowledgment of the work you put in and over-delivering on all of your objectives is very normal at Coinbase. Only about 2 in 10 engineers exceed expectations and a lot of this is based on politics in my experience here.Also if you are looking to join and think the pay equity is a good idea then you have to accept the fact that you can outwork someone by 3x who is doing the bare minimum and they will be compensated in the exact same way as you.","Verified User Current Employee  j*****  Senior Software Engineer - Apr 20, 2022  ",

Lot of politicking. - not enough EQ on exec team, but they /think/ they have it. Brian's/executive handling of BLM/blog post last year was just so poor and could have 100% been avoided if anyone on the exec team was a smidge connected to what employees were feeling. I honestly think Brian wouldn't have needed to commit to an external BLM tweet (that he was clearly so pissed about later) if he had just sent out something internally just acknowledging it's a rough time and that the company supported their Black employees, that's all they were asking for lol.

However, it's utility is still up in the air.",There's lots of politics. Mostly an incompetent LT being run by yes-people. CEO is largely checked out except for firing people that don't agree with his politics but does seem more interested in talking on Clubhouse than trying to fix problems or listening to employees.,"Verified User Current Employee  y*********  Engineer - Feb 3, 2021  ",
4,"Not perfect, but interesting work","- Overall company outlook is extremely positive. - You get to work on some of the most interesting things you'll probably ever work on, solving some tough and unique problems- ICs are a good crowd - lots of smart, driven people to learn from- Comp and benefits are pretty good. Committed to pay equity and fully remote-first culture. People and Security teams seem to really care about you. - Some good exec hires recently ","- WLB is nonexistent. Lots going on at once so you have to learn to manage your days to avoid burnout. - Very little room for career growth. Managers seem more interested in getting more done and squeezing more out of you than growing/rewarding good talent and investing in people. Most managers/directors are unnecessary. - Diversity especially in product/eng/design is nonexistent and doesn't seem on track to change (gender, ethnicity, work background etc). We say we care on paper, but management all looks the same so they don't actually make any changes. - Some politics, varies by level. Gets annoying to deal with when you just want to get things done. ","Verified User Current Employee  L*****  Product Manager - Jan 21, 2021  ",
4,"WLB varies from team to team, and the field is interesting ","The career track for the engineering got reviewed lately. Also, the company is hiring aggressively. So, you can expect more career opportunities with possible title inflation soon. The executive and management chain got a lot of new faces, mostly ex-Googlers. So, there is a heavy investment on the hiring and retaining the talent. The field itself is interesting and demanding fresh minds. If you are looking for a new challenge it will be a good company to work for. The company is on track to become public. It is possible to get a good return from your RSUs. ","For the engineering folks: Lots of tech debt that you will face. It is nothing new for any engineer joining a pre-IPO company, but get ready to pay the price of the compromises to take the products and revenue to that levels. Depending on the team that you join WLB can be tricky, try to get the sense from how crazy the hiring manager looks (do your own due diligence: ask the folks inside, do a background check on the team/manager if possible, ask on Blind about the team). Priorities change a lot. Be ready to tackle multiple things in a short period of time. This can be both pro and con depending on your personality. Overall I encourage working for Coinbase.

5,Has its challenges but incredibly rewarding,"If you want to join a company that is genuinely trying to make a mark on the world, this is it. Culture is evolving but definitely getting better over time as lessons are being learnt. Work happens at breakneck speed but management understands that fairly well. This is easily where I want to spend my next 5 years. And I've worked at FAANG before and never said that.","Requires patience at times.
