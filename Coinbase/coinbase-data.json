Lot of politicking. - not enough EQ on exec team, but they /think/ they have it. Brian's/executive handling of BLM/blog post last year was just so poor and could have 100% been avoided if anyone on the exec team was a smidge connected to what employees were feeling. I honestly think Brian wouldn't have needed to commit to an external BLM tweet (that he was clearly so pissed about later) if he had just sent out something internally just acknowledging it's a rough time and that the company supported their Black employees, that's all they were asking for lol. Then we lost like 60-70 people over the course of the next few months, even into this year cause people were asked to stay longer and not mention they opted out. - generally a big fan of remote first because of the flexibility for employees, but personally will miss going into the sf office a lot, and not gonna make the trip to south city.
