Most of the time you will be in meeting which apparently go nowhere. You will be creating several confluence pages and design docs pertaining to things which might never see the day of light just to please your manager who will in turn try to please his/her manager with these silly docs. The managers here call themselves leader which is so funny because they dont show any leader like qualitites. All they can do is throw some random fancy ideas at you and ask you to create some pages or ppts. Your manager will have no context of your work and will never try to know as well hence most of his/her work related suggestions will be of know use to you. Most of them almost no technical expertise and those who have leave the company after a year. You will expected to open yout mouth and blabber any random stuff in every forum and meeting to show how innovative you are.
