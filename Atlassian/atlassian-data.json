Current management doesn't care about culture and assumes it can be fixed with town halls/confidence pages/YouTube videos/Zoom calls.Attrition levels are within normal so when your highly knowledgeable colleague resigns - noone is surprised.Not an engineering company, so don't expect people to pay attention to stuff like performance optimisations, resource usage optimisations or anything like that. If it works - great job.No understanding of SDLC: if something is done as ShipIt project then it obviously is ready to be a dependency for any production system in the company. And no, it doesn't need constant investment in maintaining and support.Lack of investment into tooling especially its own products: Bitbucket is years behind its competitors, but the company is too proud to switch to something else that targets the company of Atlassian size as a customer.Large political plays that rival DnD: they distract your manager and his manager from unblocking you to do your job",

The managers here call themselves leader which is so funny because they dont show any leader like qualitites. All they can do is throw some random fancy ideas at you and ask you to create some pages or ppts. Your manager will have no context of your work and will never try to know as well hence most of his/her work related suggestions will be of know use to you. Most of them almost no technical expertise and those who have leave the company after a year. You will expected to open yout mouth and blabber any random stuff in every forum and meeting to show how innovative you are.  So in short if you like to show off, like to brag about tiny things and write useless docs, posses less to no tech knowledge, like buttering your manager and have all qualities of a non tech guy, this is the place for you, even better you can be a manager here and call yourself a leader.
