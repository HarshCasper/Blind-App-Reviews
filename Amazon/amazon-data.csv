Good luck trying to align goals across services unless you get an ultimatum from a SVP/burn bridges to get there. - If you’re looking to become a great PM leader, go to AWS, then leave after you’ve learned a ton, reached L7, but before you report to an eng leader (typically the single threaded owner) who only thinks being a PM is stack ranking customer asks and writing docs for them. - leadership is reacting rather than innovating.

This leads to people creating useless, redundant and faked processes in the name of team improvement which is ruining the work culture here.- The quality of engineers is hired is degrading day by day as the bar to hire people is getting weaker.

If you are experienced engineer and know how things work, or you just perform on consistent high level, you should be fine, unless your entire team is top performers, then you are screwed, cause someone has to be thrown under the bus.

All of the time, someone wants to take advantage for himself and make you hit the wall even in same team and your manager.- Leaderships is only a way of manager to enforce you to do whatever they want in name of company.- Promotion is by getting feedback only from higher levels engineer which means no senior will help joiner team team mate. Even monitoring is just number that senior add to his profile and it is very official , invaded by leadership principal and not helping you to growth.- No time for technical growth.

Solid TC compared to other consulting jobs. Bar of peers pretty consistent and solid, no duds at L5 level and many people to learn from. Good opportunities to carve your own path - you can make things happen if you drive them… and can fins the time.","Wlb still not great, even if better compared to other teams. Strong focus on Infrastructure (can be a pro if that’s what you’re looking for) - you won’t write much code. Standard consulting problems (you work for the customer, really. You hardly talk to your own team). Very poor manager visibility into work. Manager is non technical and we have very little interaction. Culture strongly favors manager and sales skills over tech, you will hit a glass ceiling if sales or management isn‘t where you want to go (again, standard consulting problems). No PMs for projects so they can be a bit of a mess. Bar of L3 and L4 mixed bag - some good, most not so much. Too much focus on my opinion on metrics and producing artifacts. Be ready to have to give interviews, write blogs and be up to your ears in training. Very top heavy, with what seems like many L6+ and not so many individual contributors. Runs on razor thing margins, don’t expect any cool perks.","Verified User Current Employee  X*****  Consultant - Apr 14, 2022",
4,"Empowering and fast-paced culture that obsesses over customers, to the detriment of employee experience","Been at Amazon for 5+ years (2x promotions, in scope for 3rd). What keeps me there is the fast-paced growth and levels of innovation. It's a difficult culture, but you learn SO much SO fast. Whenever I decide to leave, I will have a huge step up anywhere else I go. There are truly few companies that innovate and lead in as many areas as Amazon does, from retail to advertising to the Cloud to Alexa and Twitch/Prime Video/Amazon Music. So many internal opportunities to learn and they really facilitate moving around to pick up different skills. Amazon truly obsesses over customers and works hard to keep the Day One culture, which ensures the company continues to resist big company tendencies that slow us down and distract from invention. They also do spend a lot of time developing top talent. The principle of Hire & Develop The Best is truly followed and cherished by leaders. We spend so much time debating whether people are set up for success, how to accelerate their growth, how to stretch them more...I've never seen a company care so much about (top) talent growth. ","It's pretty brutal. The feedback culture and levels of disagreement & open confrontation takes a while to adjust to. The quality of doc writing and levels of dive deep required at ALL LEVELS is unusual. It is common for senior leaders to spend lots of time diving deep into an area of the business, down to the nitty gritty details. Once you learn to leave your ego at the door, this all helps you grow FAST. The employee experience w/ HR is generally not great; I have a lot of colleagues who have moved to companies like Google/Meta tell me they're treated like royalty there vs. Amazon. Amazon makes you feel like you're lucky to be there, so their attitude verges on just be appreciative that you're here. I'm a Top Tier employee with a pretty fast growth trajectory, and even I've had poor experiences with HR. They can be stubborn and unaccommodating with top employees, to the point where everyone is treated like a number. As a manager of a large team, I can also tell you they wait until employees receive counter offers from other companies to counter with a more compelling offer, vs. just paying your market rate (they will only do this if you're a top employee, if not they will happily let you go). This has become such a huge problem for them recently, with top talent leaking at record rates. Also, the frugality can be annoying over time. I am pretty senior and travel a lot – I always have to travel economy, even for 8+ hour transatlantic flights. Not even Premium Economy! Lastly, be prepared to have HUGE budgets but no resource. Amazon is so generally under-resourced that it's a hilarious pain point... all departments collectively laugh about this. They do this on purpose, to ensure we constantly invent new processes and more efficient ways of working vs. just bloating departments...it makes sense to some extent and means you own a lot of things end-to-end. But often, this can be exhausting and causes tons of burn out. DEI efforts are behind other tech companies, but they're finally starting to care more deeply. Senior leadership was (and still is) predominantly all white straight males with one-syllable names (multiple Jeffs and Jays...lol can't make this up). They didn't care/know much about this topic until about 2 years ago when it started really bubbling up in the news...not bad intentions, just pure ignorance. Now they have made some ambitious goals and implemented DEI training company-wide for the first time (a bit shocking given that companies like Google have been doing this for years now). It took them a while, but they now care and are making bold commitments, which is great news. Generally, Jassy is trying hard to make the employee experience better. This is largely a hangover from Bezos' cut-throat and customers-over-everything-at-any-expense culture. However, Amazon is good at being vocally self-critical and once it decides to change something, things tend to change fast and dramatically.

Intensity varies, but provides opportunity.* New WFH flexibility is good.* Leaders do listen, though they may not agree or agree with your perspective.* Ownership of your destiny - sometimes to a fault as you can have enough leeway to perform poorly.","Most of the negative comes from the variability across teams and the independent operation. While your team owns its destiny, so does every other team so getting alignment for your priorities can be challenging at times. This can be overcome, but requires extra effort, thought, and communication to learn to do it well.* Decentralization of decisions - while mostly a pro, it can make some work very challenging* Performance reviews can be difficult to understand.* Compensation leans more on stock grants which puts some gains in the future and you have to hang on to get them.","Verified User Current Employee  E*****  Software Manager - Apr 5, 2022",

You may say work life balance doesn't matter but when it's gone it's very strange/difficult. You go to a dark place. Take your mental health seriously. Amazon expects you to show you deserve to work there and will have a high bar for the first few years. If you can hurdle it and get on a track the money may be worth it. Up to you.Product at amazon can be extremely tedious. Doc writing and endless reviews gets old after a while only to be scraped when leadership decides your group should be doing something else. Then you start over again. etc. I know teams that work all hours of the day. A lot will depend on the team you are in. I have friends who have been at Amazon for years and love it but it's not for me.  Growth: I think you'd have to work extremely hard to get promoted at Amazon. You'll work hard and your manager will see if you can give that 120% to get promoted.Work/life: Can be abysmal. It'll depend on your team. I'm not sure how you can really parse that out in the interview without being completely direct but Amazon expects you'll hand over most of your life (my group did anyway). You'll mention how demoralizing it is and how unproductive it is, and it'll be met with apathy.Comp: Most of the benefits equation is on the comp/RSU side. That's good and bad. Very little PTO. 401k vest is years out. Dark age stuff.Culture: Not really.Management: Many have been doing the Amazon thing for years and years and they are out-of-touch with modern workplace management (empathy, listening, caring whatever).","Verified User Current Employee  Q*****  Product Manager - Mar 18, 2022",

People say it's low but that's because they're comparing only to Google, Facebook, etc. and not the whole market.There's plenty of opportunities to learn.I've heard it looks good on a resume.My recommendation to anyone considering Amazon is that if you have another offer that pays as well or better, take the other offer. If you don't have any such offer, consider whether you are willing to sacrifice WLB for comp and career growth. If you are, then maybe Amazon is for you. If you're not it's probably not.","Earth's best employer a lot of downsides1. 401k matching doesn't match until 3 years in. This means a lot of people don't get their match at all.2. Fewer company holidays and vacation. My non-Amazon friends alway get days like e.g. President's day off and we don't. Also less vacation than other companies3. They don't seem to adjust comp to keep up with the market. New grad SDE1s are getting offers for 170k+ TC but there are a lot of SDE1s (including me) still making less than that. From what I've heard this is common for external hires vs. tenured employees at every level. Why would we stay when Amazon apparently values our experience at the company negatively?4. Unregretted attrition (URA) quotas are not the right way to do performance management. We should be compared against an absolute standard of performance, not compared to each other. Relative performance evaluations means that on teams where everyone is doing well someone has to get a bad rating anyway. 5. We go on oncall and have to be responsive 24/7 and don't get any special compensation for the extra work and disruptions to the rest of our life. I know many companies have a version of this but I think ops work is worse at Amazon in general for some reason, you actually do have to work after hours pretty often.6. They down level a lot of people. I know people on my team who had 3-5 years of experience and master's degrees who came in as SDE 1, same as totally fresh new grads. That's just ridiculous, these people should be SDE 2. If they really don't meet the SDE 2 bar then that means there's a missing level between SDE 1 and SDE 2 because even the best new grads are not going to be as effective as people with years of experience for at least a year or so. This hurts the people who are downleveled obviously but it also sort of hurts the other people at the lower level who were not downleveled by causing level deflation. It's harder to get promoted when there's only so many promos per year and the people you are competing with have years of experience on you and shouldn't have had to even work for it.7. WLB isn't good. Lots of people at L6+ seem to work 60-80 hour weeks by default and act like this is normal. It seems to be just part of the culture.","Verified User Current Employee  d*********  Software Developer I - Feb 19, 2022",

It is simply easier to leave and go elsewhere, or if you really like the scope and opportunity you need to work really closely with your manager and make sure they align with your aspirations and agree to map your performance and achievements at a higher level and write a promotion document.

First two years have a bonus baked in to your pay to offset slow vesting, so it’s extremely financially stable for a tech sales role.SPIFFS on SPIFFS and endless incentives where maxing out your como is more able knowing how yup work the system than about sales skills or luck.AWS basically is a product people BUY, and not really something you SELL. Somewhere he you’re greenfield or engaged, the recurring revenue model means you’re getting paid.PRODUCTThe product suite is massive and growing, so you’re ability to solve customer problems is practically limitless, especially when you also factor in the huge partner network.YOUR BRANDHave it the logo on your CV really does hold a lot of weight, so it is a huge bump in your career.","CULTUREIt’s a toxic promo culture. Getting anything done is all about making sure you present in a way that benefits the other person. You can’t rely on anyone to do their job, as they’re usually to focused on kissing up to the person above them.NOT SALESAWS is more like sales project management than actual sales. You never negotiate a thing. You don’t sell anything the customer could get on their own. They can’t keep roles filled, as every person is trying to promo ASAP, so you end up doing the job of 3,4,5 people. It’s a common thing to encounter, and you won’t be compensated for the extra work, but you will absolutely be judged for low performance if you miss your number.CAREER GROWTHYour success is entirely a role of the dice of the first territory you’re given. You land in a gold patch, no matter what you do it will be assumed you’re doing all the right things and your career growth will be on auto pilot. Land in a crap patch and you will work hard than you ever have just to survive. Nobody will pay attention to you, and nobody will think you’re doing anything worthwhile.MANAGEMENTagain, the promo culture rules all. They like to say they are data-driven, but the only data they pay attention to are outputs and only those that influence self promotion. It’s a total joke. Working here is like a real life episode of House of Cards. Watch what you say and who you say it to. Keep track of any secrets or dirt, and learn how to manipulate, and you’ll find yourself able to maneuver how you’d like.They love to talk about how important the LPs are, but it’s more like a cult.

2,Where you can sell your soul,- Stock/Equity growth was unbeatable for a time. Literally 3 or 4x over as many years.- Some co-workers are kind and friendly to your face.- If you have the right ethnicity you can get fast track promos.- Straightforward process to switch teams when you're inevitably over your current team's issues and oncall.,"- Disastrous WLB. Expect on-call to take over your life. You'll get very few hours of sleep during oncall shifts on some teams because the systems and services are so high stakes and if you aren't on a page within minutes it's escalated to your VP.- Fake deadlines, contributing to the above. Once management gets it in their head that they want something by a date, it happens. You'll be asked to work weekends to make it happen. During the worst times I was coming in the office at 9am and leaving at 1am.- Culture so toxic Britney couldn't sing about it. Co-workers will smile to your face and then throw you under the bus during perf review season. You'll even know which co-workers are dumpstering you because they'll pull their exact quotes for you to see on your performance review.- Revolving door of management. If you don't have a lifer manager then it's 50/50 that your manager will still be there this time next year. Without this continuity, don't expect to have your manager advocate for your career advancement.- You'll be voluntold to go on loan to other teams if they can't staff up in time. Don't worry though, you'll still get to be on call for your official team every few weeks while juggling the deadlines of the loan team.- Extreme nepotism during perf review season, and nauseating unregretted attrition quotas forcing good employees to be placed on performance improvement plans and pivot. - Customer obsession, employee depression. I saw two employees cry at a meeting or at their desk, either because they thought their job was in jeopardy or their performance wasn't good enough.- Project management from hell. Directions changed and scope was cut so many times from projects that I couldn't keep up, and the docs and specs were never updated. The fake deadlines were constantly moving up due to the cut scope, and the team literally didn't have management to keep up.- Senior engineers were more concerned with their own career trajectory and glory than mentoring and helping others grow.- Non technical managers.

The PIP was deliberately designed to make me fail.I would recommend anyone who gets PIP'd to take the severance option and cause as many issues with HR as possible; it's more work and stress for management and gives them a taste of their own medicine."

In Amazon, the ceiling is way hight, which allows you to reach higher TC.","My greatest critic in Amazon is the promotion process. It changes between orgs and teams, but still is a hard process where you have to fill a 10 pages documentation, collecting feedbacks from peers on what you achieve and even collecting feedback on what you should not be promoted. It's like you have to prove yourself even after you know and everybody knows you did a good job and you deserve it. Also, to be promoted, you have to delivering as someone from your next level, meaning you are being paid to outperform our current level. There are some other points that management analysis during the promotion process: number of interviews you participated, number of commits and code changes you did in PROD, number or code reviews you did, etc. And forget it if you manager misses the promotion window, better luck next cycle. This is just painful.The culture is also not that good, because you're in a consistent awareness of having to keep delivering all the time, otherwise you'll get PIPED.Also, we have to be on-call every month or so, and trust me, besides the amount of money you can make, being paged at 2 AM on a Saturday is not funny.

Everything about this company is centered around the exploitation of the workforce on behalf of customers. Be ready to fight IT just for a nice monitor. Engineers compete directly against each other so the culture is ruthless. There’s an internal metaphor about how amazon is a pirate ship that’s pretty apt. A year or two in the comp model really starts to suck. It’s especially frustrating because your stack ranking is opaque and happens twice a year. The culture of fear is palpable. Every org has a mandate to put 12% of their engineers in danger of being let go every year, so that 6% actually leave. So there’s an awful game of musical chairs you always play. If you can’t stick around, most offers are set up so that amazon claws back every penny it legally can (3 years before any 401k match vests). This company blows overall.

2,"AWS does great for customers, but I often feel cheated as an employee","You can have a wide ranging, positive impact on the world due to the massive breadth of customers. In my experience, AWS truly does live by their motto of Earths most customer centric company.","I feel AWS is earth’s most customer-centric company at great expense to employees. To put this in perspective, I do an oncall shift every 6 weeks, where I only work on customer support tickets, security review tickets, and analyze impact when one of the AWS services we build on has a large scale event. During these weeks, I’m woken up an average of twice per week by receiving a page between 10pm-6pm. The service I’m part of is world wide, but my team exists in only one time zone (technically two temporarily because of WFH.) I estimate over 75% of these tickets do not require SDE involvement at all and can just as easily be handled by a dedicated support person, preferably stationed in time zones around the world so the wake up pages become far less frequent. I simply cannot understand why AWS does this other than out of frugality. When speaking to my manager about it, he tells me we simply don’t have resources and cites AWS ownership leadership principle- we are the Owners of our service. As far as compensation, there are two aspects that are simply bad for the employee:-401k plan vesting period is 3 years. I had never heard of something like this prior to joining AWS and didn’t even know to ask the question while discussing compensation before joining. As you can imagine, none of this is mentioned in the compensation package paperwork we receive. To top it off, there was an internal ticket opened with the compensation team outlining this and comparing it to other FAANG companies. The TT was not addressed and closed without explanation (not the first time this has happened.) Beyond the money, this attitude shown by AWS has really rubbed me the wrong way.- base salary cap. This becomes a nightmare when you are looking for your first house mortgage because banks don’t count bonus or stock towards the possible loan amount. Amazon HR told me they do deals with banks who understand this and will include bonuses too, however when I contacted two of these banks they listed, neither said they do that.Ultimately, I believe AWS is profitable enough to treat their employees better, but choose not to. In my experience, I feel this is catching up to them based on difficulty to get candidates to join and the amount of turnover. Hopefully AWS will change their ways because of this.","Verified User Current Employee  U*****  Software Development Engineer - Feb 5, 2022",

They offer free 24/7 therapist, though you will get a different person each time - unlike some other tech co's Google who I've hear offer free therapy for a consistent therapist. They offer free financial advice relating to all things finances (credit, taxes, budgeting, savings, investing, etc.) There is potential to grow here.   ","If you get a group that has a culture that is not healthy, you have to navigate that each day of your work life while there - substantially draining. It's a supportive culture in the sense that people will offer to share insight, but there is also a toxic competitive dog eat dog culture that brings that advice with a grain of salt.

1,Company needs a change in management,You can move to other teams easily. There are some cool technology problems to solve.Pay is well above average company compensation.,"Management. The four year cliff. Come in at top of band, so, if you are not promoted by year 3 then your pay will drop at the end of year 4. This is if the stock goes up at all. For big tech 160k max base pay hurts. And then you only vest 2 times a year after year 4. Leave anytime between that and you can lose a large part of your pay.How good Amazon is depends completely on your manager. There are some good managers, but there are a lot of bad ones. You ability to grow in your career is dependent upon your manager to have the drive and want to promote you. And, on top of that, some managers will only promote you for new work, and perceived impact.In order to get promoted you have to do your current job and the next level job. So, it is a carrot they will dangle in front of you to get 60 hour weeks out of you.

The two best bosses I've had have been at AWS ProServe, and that's not going to be true across the board but it has been in my case. The AWS leadership principles are actually pretty well adhered to in practice and in hiring, and despite my coworkers not being selected purely for mental horsepower and being the best of the best of the best in that regard, they are actually far better people to work with than my experience at other FAANGs. My concerns about procedural issues actually get run up the command chain and considered seriously, which is refreshing.","Main con in the current market is pay. They simply aren't keeping up for the level of experience they are seeking to hire. Another issue is the complicated nature of the promotion process, combined with the fact that stock appreciation puts newly promoted people into the next pay band already, so promotions often come with zero immediate raise, or a few shares that don't vest for 18-24 months after promotion. It's understandable from the company's bottom line but it is demotivating in practice.Another con is the unknowability of the quality of a customer engagement until you are on it.

Three people on my team have been pushed out by the same manager due to performance since I've been on the team (yet all are doing well at external companies now). The most senior engineer on the team openly talks trash about other engineers and doesn't see a need to documentation because he doesn't need, why should others? Amazon is shady about letting you switch team- multiple teammates found out they were blacklisted from switching only when they tried to leave. How many engineers have to be blacklisted from switching and pushed out of the company before you think maybe it's the manager not the engineers? Maybe he shouldn't have so much power? Anyways I'm going somewhere else that pays me more and makes me feel valued. On top of that lots of  legacy internal frameworks that feel like they could collapse at any minute (and often do).

Many months later, I asked if could work remote indefinitely, but was told no because my role was a tax break for AWS. When I told them that they made me move during the pandemic just to work from home anyways, HR and management snapped back aggressively with too bad, that’s your fault.

YMMV. - Even when in office I would show up at 11 am and/or leave at 3-4 pm many days, no one really cared as long as I was getting my work done. - Pretty flexible now can WFH forever pretty much if we want to, I personally like going in to see people 1-2 times a week but it's totally optional.- Stock price effectively doubled since I joined.","- Oncall, my team's ops aren't atrocious but I still had my fair share of getting paged in the middle of the night, weekend evenings, etc. to fix things, it's not always a quick fix. The fewer people there are on your team the more oncall rotations you end up having to do so it gets worse at times when people are leaving and there's openings to backfill. - No engineers in office means new hires, especially new grad hires, are left to mostly sink or swim with remote onboarding. I try my best to help them but it's orders of magnitude more difficult for them to ramp up and they end up asking less questions even when encouraged to, and this hurts them. - Vesting schedule is garbage and you won't see any substantial equity for the first 2 years. - If you perform well, but stock price went up, then you won't receive much raise or new shares, after all the stock price increased so you effectively got a raise they claim. BS. If you're promoted then your base salary at least has to go up to the salary band of your new role HOWEVER this band is basically static after L4->L5 promotion i.e. I know someone who got promoted to L6 (senior engineer) with no raise and no new shares because Amazon has a base pay cap and they said Well the stock price is up so you got a raise. Defeats the whole point of getting equity.- 80% of talented people I worked with on old team are gone, mostly left to other companies. Notable continued talent exodus but this is natural because Amazon comp + WLB combo is not comparable to other FAANG. So if you don't really care about your work being meaningful / doing no evil, then there are other places to flee to after a while.","Verified User Current Employee  p*****  Software Development Engineer II - Jan 17, 2022",

The interview process was the best compared to other companies where I was interviewed at this time. After the interview, I got the feeling that I passed. Then when I came to the office I instantly felt the toxic environment. People just don't see or try to avoid eye contact, not even saying informal hi at the office. Luckily it was the moment when Covid hit and we started working remotely. What is still overwhelming is the number of internal tools which don't even work properly or have a bad performance. Tons of wiki documentation is not up to date or have multiple cross-links and you just move in circles. The first month you just try to understand what is the right document to follow to configure your dev desk producing tons of notes for every error you saw because it will definitely happen again and again and again...We have to solve not trivial search problems but at the same time work as on-call, DevOps, solving non-stop security issues that may trigger critical tickets. All this happens in parallel and the manager keeps tossing new ideas to work with some team... During a day my head is spinning clicking on an uncountable number of tabs in the browser trying to pick the right tiny tab. I was laughing when I saw it the first time on my teammate's computer. Then in a couple of days, I was looking at the same in my comp...They hire mediocre juniors who cannot write readable supportable code at all but can reverse strings with closed eyes. I spend hours reviewing their stupid code to make it work at least. But I cannot keep their productivity pace, because they just may produce tons of stupidity. One guy didn't even know how to copy files on Mac... And they expect seniors to mentor these idiots who do not know the basics and don't want to study them.The managers keep asking questions providing little help. They don't actually manage anything, it looks like everything is living by itself. Nothing is finished by 100% and things are piling up until we get into serious problems.The complexity of the entire product is terrible. There are tons of wikis but no one actually has a good picture of how things work. It is a beast with random behavior and it is own mood.I think the only organizations that make a profit are AWS and retail.

I can easily choose to move to Canada or USA. I worked in a few other companies, it was not as easy as in Amazon.4. Amazon gives a lot of emphasis on being better every day. I like it. There are processes and training programs ( I liked the writing and Machine learning programs the most). The whole process in Amazon is set up as such to fight mediocracy. It has challenged me to be a better professional and person. I am surprised how people do not see it. The processes ( writing promo doc to communicate with stakeholders or the single thread owners) are designed to improve individual skills. I had read about these in books ( Biography, Productivity Management books) , but did not see any company implementing them so well that too without advertising it. In my past companies, the organization leaders would come and talk about it but will chicken out when it comes to implementing it. It's hard, very hard to do implement it, and to see some companies actually able do it. Its surreal.","1. Some people just do not understand the process and fall into the traps of bitterness. Bitterness makes them very difficult to work with them. I personally worked with a few people who would complain every day about Amazon which they have heard but never faced actually. These were the same people who would force me to send false reports and when I resisted, they spread rumors about it. How I am an Asshole or Dnt respect seniors. Gang up on me in meetings, trying to humiliate me , ex: have we not treated you well ? sarcastically, because they will accuse me that I did not hear them when they called.I was supposed to hear them every time they call me) I still try to think about when did they call me and why I did not hear them. I felt like a worthless person. It became so bad I had to leave the team and could not shake them off. I had to leave the company for around 3 years. I just could not talk about it to anyone. It was traumatizing. After three years I joined back Amazon after I was able to process what has happened.These were the same people who were talking negatively about Amazon and at the same time, I saw them as the same people who were creating this toxic env. If you are joining Amazon be careful with these people. A sure-short red flag will be, if they talk too much negativity and tell that as the reason why must slack and protect themself. RUN. Do not look back, reach out to friends, or friends of friends, and change team. If required just leave the company and join back in another team. it does not worth working with them.

Management is not cultivated and individual contributors are promoted to management without a real aptitude for the role.

There is no wiggle room. If you are a competent people manager able to get the best out of people, you will still have to pick at least one person to be LE. This results in the hire to fire approach you read about in NY Times and other reputable news sources. There is also another less-known loophole leadership will take advantage of. If you decide to transfer to another team but your transfer window happens to be within 45 days of when ratings are set for the year, your old team may decide to keep you up to the 45 days allowed per internal transfer policy for business reasons and then give you the LE rating since you are already leaving the team anyway. This way, they don't have to give the LE to someone who is staying on the team and they avoid all the hassle associated with that. Of course, this means the receiving team has to deal with the LE rating and the further impact on the employee on their new team in that they don't receive additional stock and so on. I've seen this happen. The old manager actually wanted to give a middle rating (3 on a 5 point scale) and somehow was overruled by the VP to be given the bottom rating. It is unfair but within the rules of the system. This then creates a culture of fear among employees. And mistrust. You really don't want to help peers within your org because if they get a step up, you may be stuck with the LE. It's like playing poker: if you can't identify the sucker, you are the sucker.

Code quality is very high. - Amazon has a vast variety of teams. There are more opportunities to move around and try something new.- Amazon offers good seminars on topics like sprint planning, Alexa code labs, interviewing, and more.- As being the founder of AWS, every team is basically shifting to use AWS. These are marketable skills that you can take to most other jobs, as most smaller companies tend to favor AWS for their cloud infrastructure.","- Depending on your team, you either get good work/life balance (IMDb) or bad work/life balance (AWS). The more your product is used, the worse your work/life balance will be. Mostly tends to lean more towards bad work/life balance.- Oncall experience was bad, have been paged at every hour of the day at least once. - Compared to other large companies of a similar caliber, compensation is not high. Everyone knows they're expendable the moment they enter the company.- Only compensation that's really worth anything is the Amazon stock. But even that has a ridiculous vesting structure where most of it vests after the average amount of time people spend at the company.- As with big companies, processes tend to slow down development. If you are looking for a fast-paced environment and not to be a cog in a large machine, this is not the job for you. - From my particular experience, there was a high turnover rate where people left the team once a month.  - With the recent hiring surges of attempting to recruit me once more from my current job, it seems like Amazon is desperate to hire.

3,Good for career growth but can be a greulling culture,"I'm not the first to write a review on Amazon nor will I be the last. Most of this will be what has already been said but I'd like to still outline my experience here. The biggest pro of this is that the culture will push your boundaries to a point where you wouldn't believe you could have accomplished what you will here. The entire system is woven around a growth culture and this is a place that does not accept slow delivery for any cost. For a data scientist, my organization at AWS is pretty stable with a strong leadership and well definined roles so there's no analysis monkey complaint with me. Amazon hires from all tiers of colleges and workplaces and the interview bar for getting in, though not easy, is not amongst the toughest to crack. But once you're in, you learn the Amazon way of doing things - requires a bit of getting used to but once you know how things work, everything becomes bearable and you'll be way more confident than you were before getting in. Is it enjoyable though? The cons section will tell","While the growth prospects of Amazon is great, the culture to get there is not praiseworthy. Although I have not personally faced any of the ghastly stories of some of my fellow blind mates, it's just a matter of chance or time perhaps. Deadlines never end and one is always in the state of haven't completed XYZ throughout the day. There is no other validation other than promotions and pay raises - that don't come often - sucking into this never ending vortex of promo docs and forte feedbacks. Nobody appreciates anybody and when they do, people have a robotized way of giving kudos or shoutouts making it blatantly obvious that they care more about the visibility/metrics that come with it than with truly aplreciating somebody's efforts. When one onboards, they're thrown in an ocean of wikis and material - left alone to figure everything out. The first six months is spent in imposter syndrome and the rest of the career here in masking it in flowery Amazon jargon. All in all this is a great place to challenge yourself and learn more, until you want to prioritize your mental health, at which point you should move along.

If you are very good at maintaining processes but not good at innovating you will not succeed at amazon. Longer term this means Amazon hires ambitious high achievers and many of them are yoked with keeping the lights on. If you are keeping the lights on as a central portion of your responsibilities then you will not meet or exceed expectations of high achievement and you will be shown the door. This keeps a portion of the employee base under constant threat of dismissal due to the nature of their jobs. On the other hand, attaining a promotion is difficult due to stiff competition from highly competent high achievers and staggeringly effective liars, resulting in sabotage and backstabbing. Management has no idea what you are working on but they know what you present on. There is an ongoing race to present on projects even if people didn't work on them.

This can affect your ability to apply for promo with a strong case, especially if any key people you’ve worked with (including your manager) leave before this process is finished. * LPs are weaponized to essentially promote a burnout monoculture, where you take on too many projects/tasks and are asked to act a certain way to get respect (e.g. talk assertively in meetings, cater to multiple senior/principal individuals on your team, etc.).* Salary base increases are minuscule (even after promotion) and RSUs are handed out sparingly due to its high price.

The vast majority of Amazon roles are operational and boring, you are either extinguishing fires, crunching numbers in Excel, or writing docs for WBR, MBRs, QBRs, OP1s, COEs, Forte's...HR is practically a robot - they would like you to piss off with your miniscule requests every time you come to them.   The comp stalls after year 4 - the math is that overtime you are below the peers in other tech companies. Promotion process is a nightmare - to get from 5 to 6 (which is only a Senior level!) takes 1.5 years after your manager agreed that you're worthy and in that time you are literally their personal slave because they have leverage over you.

","- Comp falls steeply on year 5 and even after a promo, you still won’t reach the levels from year 1-4 during stock growth. If stock flatlines or falls, I’m not confident that Amazon will make up for it to the employees.- Promotion process is over-complicated and convoluted. You have to put in 200% effort to get a promo and put together materials for your promo docs (whether you or your manager write them). Doing good work is not enough, you have to really bust your ass (even though after promo, you can go back to working normally). And after all that, you may get shot down for very arbitrary or nitpicky reasons during leadership’s promo reviews. Probably my biggest complaint because it’s the only real way to increase salary after year 4. - Work life balance can be tough. In both the US and EU you’ll have to occasionally work longer hours.- Work is stressful and you’ll be thinking about it even when off work or on PTO.- If you’re an engineer in AWS, you can have some rough oncall schedules.- On less-good teams, you’ll struggle to find meaning in what you’re doing, learning will stall, energy will be gone.

This is fine aspirationally but in practice has loads of problems you can search for on blind.Amazon comp is now lagging the market severely. Its comp philosophy heavily benefits new hires and screws over existing hires, even those who have the best performance ratings. I have been promoted once and have constantly achieved the top performance rating in my 5+ years at Amazon, yet a brand new hire that I need to train and handhold can be making 100K more than me. Amazon wake up. You’re ok losing average or underperformers but when you’re losing top performers, this company only has one way to go — down.I have seen a constant trickle out of top performing senior engineers and managers, even directors and VPs because of bad culture and bad comp philosophy. Most of the people I work with now are too new to know any better and sorry to say but they are no longer the exceptional talent I used to work with. The declining bar, immense number of new policies put in place (policy engine), and slowing rate of development tell me that Day 2 is here, and here to stay.With Jeff Bezos cashed out and enjoying his billions, I don’t know if anybody can turn this company around now, or if it’ll just become the next Walmart, IBM, or HP.","Verified User Current Employee  w*******  Software Engineer III - Aug 19, 2021",

I was in a much more senior role in a small company and responsible for several different teams across many countries and I was compensated nearly half of what Amazon is paying me. In my role at Amazon I get to focus on one core area where I'm becoming the expert across a scale I've never been apart of before. ","Data requests to gain insights to help me complete my work can move slow and it delays papers and approvals needed to move forward. I haven't been apart of a large company before and the slow speed on requests can be painful for me sometimes. The pay is better than what I previously was compensated, but I've been recruited multiple times now by smaller companies offering similar roles and the comp offer has often been higher. It seems people are tying to build their teams to set themselves up to be promoted, rather than because they actually need the resource. It's in direct conflict with the Frugality leadership principle, but building out these teams with duplicate roles and vague, ambiguous responsibilities is rewarded with the opportunity to advance because scope has increased. Amazon also wants you to be an expert in one area, they really seem to keep people focused on their area even when they're hiring big leaders externally who are capable of overseeing a much larger scope.

4,It depends on you and your team,"My experience at Amazon has been that it is fast-paced and fun. Individual contributors have a surprising amount of autonomy. If you want to start a new project (or even a new product), you can do so if you can set out your idea in a document and present your reasoning. If you are competent, ambitious, and work well under pressure, Amazon will be a good place for you.","Amazon is not homogeneous, and your experience will depend greatly on your team and management. If you ever end up underperforming - especially if it's because you aren't a good fit (or even because your team or manager is overworked), you will have a really hard time, and may not even be able to move to another team. To succeed, you must land in a team you work well in, and in that sense there's a huge element of luck involved. If you don't, it will color the remainder of your experience at the company.Career growth can be extremely difficult at Amazon, depending on your org. As a result, the quality of senior employees (L6+ ICs, L7+ managers) varies excessively. Those who were promoted into a senior level are excellent. However, because it is so difficult to be promoted internally, the company has to fill the gap with external hires. The criteria for promotion are different from those for hiring, and as a result, there are many senior employees who were hired from outside who fail to raise the bar.Because Amazon's culture favors ambitious people, there is the potential for personality clash within a team. I also think performance management is a little too political. The performance review and promotion processes strongly depend on gossip between managers. To get ahead, you will need not only to do your job well, but also to curry favor with the other managers in your org.","Verified User Current Employee  a***  Software Development Engineer - Aug 15, 2021",

3,Could be better (AWS),This review is specifically for AWS Solutions Architecture org. There a ton of smart people who are always eager to help. Lots of opportunities to learn new technologies and thought leadership. Everyone lives by the Leadership Principles unlike other Orgs where you’ll see the extent to which they have a company vision is prints on the back of their badge. PIPs are almost non-existent as far as I have seen because the collective global team is ready to help each other grow and develop which is truly remarkable.,"So far the cons have outweighed the pros unfortunately. Not quite sure where to start but let me give it a try. Most people in SA org are ICs and even though you’re an IC your progression and performance is heavily dependent on the team you’re in. There are ridiculous expectations in the name of raising the bar with broken tools and processes involved. I’ve read a lot of fast paced comments and reviews but I think the appropriate term is chaos. Leaders constantly re-prioritize things and change procedures that it’s almost hard to keep up, tons of repetitive processes that you’ll be bogged down with instead of actually doing real work. You will also need to depend heavily on external/other teams for your growth within the company and to help your customers, and although some of the teams are great most others are simply NOT that great in collaborating/helping, not because they don’t want to but because they are either understaffed or overworked. If you are a Generalist SA, your life is simply going to be hard because apart from accounts that you are handling you’ll be expected to be an active participant in a specific technical area. The specialization area you chose will either make or break you, cuz each of these areas operate differently either as a well oiled sophisticated machine or like a broken Ford Fiesta. As part of these engagements you’d also have to interact with Engineering teams, and toxicity and ego runs deep there. The SA Org has been relatively great but toxicity from engineering/service teams seems to be slowly creeping into our org which is unfortunate. That’s not to say there aren’t great Engg teams, I’ve interacted with a few and it’s been a remarkable experience. Attrition rates throughout the SA Org has reached alarming levels, just in the past two weeks 6 people I knew, and closely worked with, have left. I have heard teams collectively complain about compensation to leadership and them turning a blind eye with a meh response. AWS simply isn’t competitive enough in the market atleast for SAs, and there’s hard and fast data available for it (so much for a company that claims to be data driven). From a customer point of view, having interacted with more than a dozen customers so far, it really does sound like customers are catching up to the fact that AWS has gotten into a habit of releasing services/features that are nowhere near close to prime time. So there’s always a healthy dose of skepticism we get from customers when talking to them even about well established features. Ultimately, you can be a very happy employee here but you have a mountain to climb to get there. Some have the patience and time to do it, others (the majority) don’t and so they simply leave.

As of today, it is common to meet (and have to work with) thoroughly unimpressive people that you wouldn’t believe have met/exceeded the hiring bar. A lot of this has to do with not growing your internal employees fast enough and losing them to competitors.

Not the other way round.It pains me to see the company I loved so much for a long time to come to this state. Trying to help undo this by contributing to the hiring process and hold a high bar.

Promo process is not straightforward or particularly fair.,"Verified User Current Employee  L*****  Product Manager - Jul 5, 2021",
4,Great place to grow professionally and personally,"I am in the finance function and have worked at Amazon for four years, rotated three teams, currently at AWS. I generally enjoy Amazon's innovative culture, appreciate my smart colleagues, and the opportunity and growth it has given me.Career Growth - Career growth is probably the biggest pro working at Amazon. If you are hard working and can deliver results, you will get promoted fast. This is my 4th year working here. My first promotion is at 2.5-year mark and my manager is now working on my next promo doc. Myself started as an IC and now have a team of three. I've promoted one of my own team member and now I am writing a promo doc for a 2nd team member. I am considered being promoted at a pretty normal pace. I see capable people get promoted 3 times within 5 years.  I worked in the public sector pre-MBA and Amazon is the first tech firm/large private company I work for in my life. Recruiters reach out to me all the time on Linkedin. I am ready to try out other companies and I like that I have a wide range of options.  Compensation - Compensation is decent, although finance and business folks don't get paid as generous as engineers. When I graduated from business school and came to Seattle four years ago, my net worth was negative mainly due to the student loan. Now that I not only paid off my student loan, but also have decent savings, a house I can easily afford, and am about to buy a second place.  It certainly helps that Amazon stock value tripled from when I joined the company. Personal Growth - First thing is that you will be working with lots of smart people with great career experience. They help raise the bar for you and motive you. I've learn to work hard and work smart from my managers, my team, and my business partners. They inspire me to become a better self. Another thing is that you will get to learn some great methods here, such as starting with customers and working backwards. The company makes sure to ingrain these philosophy into your daily work and becomes a habit, so that you don't lose focus of the big picture/end goal while completing detailed work. I find such methods beneficial to my personal life too.  Company Culture - I will talk about the cons of the company culture too. The biggest pro of Amazon's company culture is innovation. Even in the finance function, where we make fun of ourselves as glorified accountants, we have team goals and individual goals to innovate our work process in order to make it faster, more accurate, and more scalable in order to better support the business. If you use the same process for a whole year without improvements you will get questioned why you didn't invent and simplified. Improved/invented/simplified process is a must-have in your promo doc.  ","Work Life Balance - WLB in the finance function is no good. Amazon loves planning and we have 3 planning (budgeting) cycles each year that occupy ~9 months. This means you only have ~3 months each year to take vacation and get the big projects done. During the planning cycles, I easily work 10 to 12 hours per day and often have to work several hours to one day per weekend. Last week my manager called me and two other teammates at 9:30PM to work thru an issue. We hung up the phone before 11pm and 2nd morning resumed work at 8am. There are constant rework and revision on the planning models/docs due to multiple levels of leadership reviews and business decision back-and-forth. This type of intensity and unnecessary churns make people frustrated and often is the reason they leave the team/company. Company Culture - What I don't appreciate is the so-called frugality. I am not talking about free lunch or free beer. I don't care about these marginal benefits. My problem is specifically - the company doesn't give enough headcount or resources to the finance function. It is not un-common that one finance person supports a business with multi-billion dollar revenue and hundreds of business + SDE headcounts. And you own everything from monthly/quarterly financial reviews, operational budget approvals, headcount planning, pricing strategy, plus three planning cycles and planning doc writing. On top of that you have to do bunch of non-strategic, non-value add administrative type of jobs such as monitoring several idiotic finance systems that make data mistakes all the time, battling with the system teams, and correcting the data errors; being a finance data monkey for your business team and pulling data from messy databases etc. This is why folks in finance rotate much more frequently than business or engineer teams, which adds churns on knowledge transfer and team stability. This is also the root cause of why WLB is bad for finance teams, especially at AWS. ","Verified User Current Employee  w********  Finance Manager - Jul 5, 2021",

2,Sinking Stepping Stone,Compensation is excellent the first few years. Ex-Amazonians sometimes have an easier time interviewing externally.,"Amazon and AWS are demanding places to work. In most of Amazon and AWS, software managers convert from non technical roles. These managers are responsible for unrealistically demanding work estimates. These managers will assign you document writing when you ask them a question they don't understand. The executive class are brilliant but they will aggressively micromanage your L6/L7 managers to squeeze employees until they burn out. Maintaining your salary requires performing better than you did the year before and better than most of your coworkers. I've heard software managers using homophobic slurs and blame a pregnancy for missing their goals.

Especially HR. HR should declare conflict of interest when investigating any reported issues. 2.Respect: respecting all employees. Some managers from my experience would disrespect his/her reportees.

Dicrimination based on origin or religion is a standard behavior. Although it has been broughted many times to HR, the end result was an exit package to the employees who reported them with a statement that there are no such issues.

Scale of engineering systems is large, providing a playground to build and develop exciting technology and use cases involving that technology.","1. Stack Ranking. While they deny it, stack ranking is real. You have to fit employees on a bell curve under the ratings and there is a quota. Which means you can’t have more than X% of employees in any one bucket. Buckets are like TT, HV3, HV2, HV1, LE.2. Mandatory URA. Comes from point 1 of cons. There is a mandatory LE bucket which means you always need to fill in that LE bucket.3. The above 2 cons constitute to terrible culture where team work is not promoted, rather individuals try to not help their team members in order to protect themselves from being put in LE bucket.4. Point 3 constitutes to hunger games toxic culture.5. Managers are forced to use above performance policies. If managers don’t, they are let go. This shifts the blame from policies to managers unfortunately.6. Compensation structure is not employee friendly. There are companies paying better than Amazon with even better cultures.7.

The culture is just that bad. So they probably think, we all have to suffer here, and you aren’t going to dodge it. They can act like they care, in front of everyone or during your 1-on-1, but let’s face it, they aren’t going to do anything to change it. Because that requires them to admit and challenge the system.Colleagues are horrible and back stabbing. They act like your friends in front of you (because of Amazon’s fake networking culture) that you’re expected to be all lovey friendly with everybody, but you’ll find people talking shit behind their best friend at work’s back!And when L7 asks who achieved this great thing, you’ll be surprised to find a colleague taking the credit belonging to you right in front of your eyes!They can offer you a good chunk of comp in RSUs. That could make you a target when managers want someone gone/PIP’d to hit their quota. And they’d do it to those who have RSUs ready to be vested (when you hit 1 year or 2 and every 6 months after that.) If they fire you, they can claw back the non-vested RSU offered to you.People say it’s easy to switch team internally, yes to an extend. But if your team wants you gone or just aren’t happy with you, don’t even wish for a chance to rotate teams. Many of us sucked up our bosses’s dick for a year or two with no life left may not even get to switch successfully.I’ve seen a lot of horrifying things happen to people at Amazon that I wouldn’t wish for anybody.Amazon doesn’t like to increase you much on base and sign on. Your recruiter would probably say I can give you couple of more shares in total. They might even tell you that you’re almost capped/at high of the band.The way Amazon works is they give you high on stocks, and if you want to keep the same sign on or increase your base, you’ll have to work your ass off and try to switch teams and negotiate a new offer. On avg people change roles every 1.5-2 years. And if you didn’t want to stay at Amazon anymore or if your leadership doesn’t love you or if they’re shitty, they’ll prevent you from rotating, then you’re stuck with no bonus or laid off. Then again, you lose all the non-vested shares.One should really assess their offer without the RSUs and ask themselves, would I still be happy for that 1-2 years if I weren’t going to get the RSUs after all?That’s also one way they do to trap you in and burn you out 🔥 because no matter how shitty they treat you, people are gonna suck up until stock vested.Those who love themselves more would just move on from the company.There are a few notorious teams with high turnover and high short handed vacancies. They might even pay a little extra to you with saved dollars from those empty roles that you’ll be taking on. It’s not uncommon for VMs to work multiple jobs, and by that I mean literally multiple jobs. There are colleagues who are both VM and Marketing MGR for their product family. 😂😂😂😂😂Oh, and of course you can’t see any of these from your interviews and all the contacts you’ve had so far. Things only go upside down drastically once you’re in and a few weeks from there. Buckle up!Avoid Retail period.

They won't show any empathy as to how much work is to be done per developer, and all that is looked upon is deadline. Management thinks adding more and more people into a same project will help them meet a deadline faster, but someone tell them Men and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them.

It gets a bit annoying when you spend entire days fixing dependencies rather than features and get derailed.- Amazon is pushing everyone to a new philosophy of implementation (NAWS) but everything is built in the old way (MAWS) so it gets really annoying try to build something new since the supports not really there. There's a disconnect behind the initiative and the teams.- Basically just feels like your mostly a SRE when working on an Amazon team as an SDE. (That could be a pro for some, but i prefer feature work).- Yearly compensation philosophy sucks (basically if the stocks go up in value, that's your raise)- Promo process is really tedious. You need to gather hard evidence and write up a document to meet certain pillars. If you don't have evidence, your manager will tell you to find some or will try to get you some, but then you're just at the mercy if you can get the correct type of work assigned to you to meet the requirements.- Generally a cheap company.

1,"The most toxic, dysfunctional, psychopathic company ","Some think it’s a good entry-level-job or a foot in the door, especially for a later career in FAANG. I can certainly understand the sentiment behind how beggars can’t be choosers. But, please consider the reality and fact that, in today’s time and age: 1) Amazon is no longer considered a real FAANG company like the way it was back in the day. Amazon’s notoriously toxic and truly abusive culture, its extremely unreasonable work demands, the aggressive and relentless PIP process, the rampant hypocrisy and toxic politics, coupled with the clear decline in talent over the years (no talented and strong engineer would never consider staying for longer than 1 year), the atrociously high attrition rate (I guess this is expected given the gigantic mass talent exodus + everyone and their moms, dads, sisters, friends, uncles, neighbors, and grandparents are getting PIPed left and right every day— check out their stupid URA quota) every day 😂 = very few ppl actually left to do the work). Oh, Amazon is also having an extremely difficult time hiring any talent (bc of their extremely poor reputation world-wide), so any team you join will likely be super under-resources. And very likely just gone in a month. So, just think very carefully about this. Everyone always thinks they’re gonna be the exception and not the rule. Trust me: you will not be the exception. ","I think I will get some serious sprains in my wrists if I even try to type out 1/3 of the problems plaguing this sad, unethical, exploitative company. Some key highlights here( all can be independently verified, so please STFU HR about how none of the thousands and thousands of criticisms are true 😂) • The concept of WLB literally doesn’t exist. Amazonians genuinely don’t understand what that means. So, you WILL be working 996 hours, many times working 12 hour days consistently for weeks too. • You will be evaluated in every way possible at every moment. Watch how you breathe, walk, talk, take a shit. Everything is watched. It’s truly a 1984/North Korea-like atmosphere. Trust no one here. Be on guard all the time, 24/7. Assume that ppl will always screw you over for their own gain, because they will. Multiple times. It’s really not personal. The culture is just a dog-eat-dog world of extreme Hunger Games. So screw people over or you will be screwed over. • Your health and well-being, from your physical body to your sleep to your mental health, WILL be negatively affected. You won’t have time to work out or prepare healthy food bc of the heavy workload. Threats of PIP and the constant hypervigilance of suspecting everyone is out to get you (bc they are) and the constantly need to be on guard + the exhausting politics games and kissing ass game will stress you to a level you have never felt before. You will maybe need some psychiatric help and medications. No shame in this bc a lot of ppl after starting Amazon have needed to resort to taking meds in order to handle the shit that is Amazon. Also, I am being sincere here— please try to find a good mental health/licensed therapist. You will definitely need to seek their service in the future. • Oh also, 🥜 and 🍌 for payment.  Bc they do not see you as an actual human. Isn’t that obvious from the way they abuse, mistreat, destroy their workers?","Verified User Former Employee  e*********  Software Applications Engineer - Jun 1, 2021","It just honestly wasn’t worth it. No company is worth you feeling dehumanized, humiliated, ashamed, threatened, discriminated, and traumatized. No company is worth the significant harmful stress on your physical body, mental health, and emotional health. No company is worth your soul and humanity (the company is pretty transparent in its high valuation and appreciation of sociopathic people who thrive on putting others down. People with the Dark Triad traits (lack of concern or empathy for others, regularly uses manipulation, deception, and threats to obtain their goals, see people as a means to an end rather than as, you know, actual humans, anti-social/callous/sociopathic/psychopathic traits with an extreme drive to obtain power at ALL COSTS will truly thrive here. I am just not even close to having any of the traits that Amazon values. And I don’t ever want to invariably develop ANY of these traits or accidentally mistreat others in any of the atrocious ways like the Amazonians I work with. Oh, and I also think that having to take medications and undergo therapy (something that has never happened to any of us before until we got to Amazon) just to somehow cope and survive in an extremely toxic environment is 💯not worth it. Our environments truly have such a significant impact on our behavior, thoughts, and character. No amount of TC or prestige (tho Amazon is def not considered as prestigious now) or POWER would ever convince me to work in such environments again. It was truly one of the darkest times of my life.

You won’t just be an expert in a tiny bubble - you’ll handle real customer problems and have a chance to change anything you don’t like.","Learning caps quickly, as you’ll realize that 99 percent of the work at Amazon is to take what already exists and package it into something customers will like.Expect to be laid off if you have any minor life event. Break a leg? Dealing with a breakup or divorce? Someone died? Depressed? Expecting a child or maybe just a period? Amazon expects daily delivery and it can be difficult to handle even a couple of days of downtime. Amazon will self select to only keep the highest performers - typically males in their 20’s who also have no liabilities.Amazon is frugal to the extent that it can impede daily work or growth, which can be quite annoying.

1,Go for limited engagement if you must,Stocks took off during my tenure. I learned a lot about AWS and cloud computing. Velocity of change is nice compared to some companies.,"Leadership doesn’t take customer obsession seriously or they wouldn’t continually release MVP products that introduce immediate, years-worth of technical debt which is always deprioritized in favor of the next new shiny feature or service. This is disastrous and some customers know it intimately. And then we spout leadership principles publicly as if they are some code that we really live by.Stock appreciation is not a good compensation model. It’s been good to me but now my stock refreshers are slowing down so I have to work extra hard to get TT. I almost had a heart attack (literally) just to earn a HV rating in a project with broad impact and influence in 2020 so I’m not doing TT, which aside from not being meritocratic, is quite political. Management is not concerned with your growth. You own your promotion is the silliest policy.  Why have managers? Your relationship may start off talking about career growth but eventually it’s just going to talk about projects and what you’re supposed to deliver. If your management chain isn’t interested in promoting you, it’s an uphill battle regardless of how much of your own doc you write. You think it’s a fair process? Try dealing with management and leadership who doesn’t believe in you or your multi-team spanning projects and on top of that wouldn’t think to give you any opportunity with the new shiny projects they really value.","Verified User Current Employee  t*****  Engineer II, Software Development & Engineering - May 15, 2021",
