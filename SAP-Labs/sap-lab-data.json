			"desc": "Great place to coast, but not for growth",
			"pros": "Working at SAP is like working for the federal government. It's a well funded bureacracy with so much division of labor and redundency that it safely and consistently achieves its modest goals as a legacy enterprise software company-- for better or worse.This sprawling organization creates plenty of well paying jobs, and once you're middle management, you make decent money and stock bonuses each year. Compensation isn't FAANG-level, but it is outsized considering that you probably only work a few hours a day (not that you would ever admit that). Promotions come with tenure, and larger raises come with politicking. It's a steady gig that can allow you to enjoy your family or other pursuits relatively stress-free if you realize there are very few consequences for remaining mediocre and keeping a low profile. It's respectable enough work and it pays the bills.For those who like politics and have Game of Thrones ambitions, it's a big enough company where that works too. Large teams and large paychecks can be achieved if you can win that game. ",
			"cons": "Unfortunately the federal government's approach to enployment also selects for mediocrity. Signing up for SAP also means forfeiting any expectation of technological innovation, huge career growth, or changing the world.  See the pros above for why that isn't a bad thing for everyone. SAP's safe approach also means it's slow. Hour decisions take a week; something that takes days elsewhere takes months. This can be frustrating. The company is too big to have a unifying goal or culture. SAP covers the world-- every industry, every country, and every business process. Each team or BU feels their niche is the future of the business, but none of them will never feel the weight of the entire company behind them or their goals. Internal teams compete for resources and the attention of sales and marketing. Much smaller competitors can take advantage of areas where SAP investment is spread thin. You'll understand firsthand how disruption happens in software. Culture and HR's approach can also feel a bit manufacuted or inauthentic, sometimes bordering on parody.Complete lack of leadership at the top with a complete lack of diversity in background or experience.",
