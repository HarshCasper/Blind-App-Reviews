Not much incentive to stay and build your career over time.- Too many ineffective managers and leaders at the company. Favoritism geared towards people who are URMs, who are part of the clan, or who know how to play politics rather than someone who has the vision or technical chops to lead an organization.- Not much strategic vision - a lot of bad acquisitions and divestitures which cost the company a lot of money (the money could have been better spent elsewhere). A lot of failed internal projects.- Lots of massive layoffs (SET, ACT, etc) which results in a depleted talent pool within the company.- Name is a liability.
