I\u2019ve seen plenty of new candidates receive better packages or hired at a higher grade level, while the ones that have contributed immensely are stuck with poor compensation and/or need to go through the management bs for a promotion. Worse, the new ones left in a year or two without contributing anything of significance to the project. What does management need more to reward its loyal engineers.This corporation is a joke.

A very drive your vendors to get work done attitude, with no interest in working on the amazing challenges and opportunities the business provides.Promising ten dogs the same biscuit attitude by the managers, instead of directly letting engineers know where they stand. While promotions are hard to come by, they can certainly up the recognition in terms of internal awards (which are peanuts). The drive to even apply for awards for engineers does not exist with much of the management. Many teams have no interest in applying for patents or Intel top secret documents.

There will be false promises, favors played behind your back, and then always the standard excuse that this years budget is just bad. I have lost all trust in the entire management chain.Pay is not on same level as competition is willing to pay. That is not how you retain talent. Or attract RCGs. Not sure what management is thinking. During a BUM last year Bob mentioned salaries in some fields were inflated, and Intel was not willing to follow that trend. Well, Bobby, how do you expect people to stay and be motivated then? You want to be a big boy? Gotta pay like one then.Intel groups are slowly bleeding people to competitors, both in SW and HW. This will likely just continue. Last BUM decreased my confidence in our \u2018leaders\u2019 again.I can\u2019t recall a single successful acquisition in recent years.Future looks dim at the moment.
