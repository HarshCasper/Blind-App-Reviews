Both do the same type of jobI will recommend to join only as a blue badge employee because there is no guarantee you will get converted from red badge to blue badge",I would run out of words with the number of challenges there is for blue badge employees -no investment- no training - no salary hike - no more conversion from red to blue- no proper training for the technology they will hire,"Verified User Former Employee  d*********  Support Engineer - Apr 20, 2022",-no investment- no training - no salary hike - no more conversion from red to blue- no proper training for the technology they will hire

Really hard to get promoted or achieve financial goals. Stock hardly moves so the tiny RSU grants mean even less. If comp was significantly better or more of a focus for rewarding high performers it would be pretty darn good. Instead high performers get bored and have pretty much zero motivation to be better than average. Maybe once a year you can really push for a promotion but the budget for promos is basically zero so even if you do happen to work super hard and do a lot and manage to achieve a promotion you'll get like a 2% bump, maybe 5% if you win the promo lotto lol. It's better to leave at some level and then come back a year later and interview into the next level than it is to get promoted, or transfer within the company to another business unit but that's basically taking another job so, same thing.

3.0,"Meraki, a sad place to work","Covid has made us work remote but food at Meraki was good..still free but not what it used to be. Your management has no clue what you do its a great place to work on a lot of different things i suppose. Get to work with a lot of different teams, people are great and you can lead a lot until mgmt gets in the middle. Being part of Cisco is a plus. ","Management at Meraki leaves a lot to be desired, bad managers seem to have found a great place to work. If you speak Hindi or non english the managers have a talk with you to only speak in English. In the same breath theyre promoting diversity, inclusion and all the other buzz worthy stuff. If you're white youre good, you'll have fast track to promotions and opportunities. Black or Brown you have to be really careful, its a yes sir culture, if you question things being asked of you..well don't do it too often. Be Brave is your ticket to getting written up and these white people turning on you real quick. Meraki still talks startup culture, at this point its more silos than Cisco mothership. Its in the company surveys every year..but the focus is the highlights.The answer from HR is usually talk to your manager or submit a request in some portal if you have concerns. You cant really talk to your manager when youre complaining about them. Its talk to your manager so they can build a case against you and get the paperwork started to fire you... i have seen people fall into this trap many times. They're just weeding out the people that were brave, ironically Be Brave was supposed to be a core value. ","Verified User Current Employee  R*****  Operations Specialist - Aug 9, 2020",
5.0,Great work-life balance ,"Because of Cisco move the software, a lot of good stuff to work on. Can work on any industry by just moving around the teams.

3.0,Good WLB sadly people abuse it,A good place for people who know how to navigate through office politics. They can survive for decades doing nothing. Best place to be if you are leet coding for FAANGs,"Compensation falls short on competitiveness. Asking for adjustment on compensation has very little effect. Better chance of career growth if one is of Indian or Chinese origin under of same origin boss. On top of that add yes boss mentality at the expense of products. Very few people care about the product they are working onVery bureaucratic. Code repositories of the same product are locked away on ethnic lines. Chinese teams lock theirs away from USs and Indians, and Indians the same. A single product is partitioned into ethnic groups, the blame game, the slow communication through partition layers makes me wonder if there is any future at all.","Verified User Current Employee  #*********  Software Engineer - Aug 8, 2020",
