Stock hardly moves so the tiny RSU grants mean even less. If comp was significantly better or more of a focus for rewarding high performers it would be pretty darn good. Instead high performers get bored and have pretty much zero motivation to be better than average. Maybe once a year you can really push for a promotion but the budget for promos is basically zero so even if you do happen to work super hard and do a lot and manage to achieve a promotion you'll get like a 2% bump, maybe 5% if you win the promo lotto lol. It's better to leave at some level and then come back a year later and interview into the next level than it is to get promoted, or transfer within the company to another business unit but that's basically taking another job so, same thing. I wouldn't have much to complain about (maybe slowness) if comp was a lot better.

Be Brave is your ticket to getting written up and these white people turning on you real quick. Meraki still talks startup culture, at this point its more silos than Cisco mothership. Its in the company surveys every year..but the focus is the highlights.The answer from HR is usually talk to your manager or submit a request in some portal if you have concerns. You cant really talk to your manager when youre complaining about them. Its talk to your manager so they can build a case against you and get the paperwork started to fire you... i have seen people fall into this trap many times.

The tough part is you can get distracted a lot and if the manager still expects you to produce 40 hours of work result, then it may be tough.",
