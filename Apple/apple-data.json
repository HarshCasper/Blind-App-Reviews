Also, WLB is not great for people who take more responsibility and are higher up on the career ladder. - Internal team switches are extremely difficult and is generally not encouraged. ",

If my boss doesn't know, how should I know?I have a rough overall picture, but I'm missing exact details about what other teams are doing. I've got 50+ top secret disclosures in the company and still I don't know what our closest collaborators are doing besides the tiny trickle of information they give us. This leads to a really toxic culture where managers are able to lie through their teeth at one another about how great their teams are and what they're working on. Because nobody actually knows anything there's no way to verify any claims. This goes vertically as well. Managers tend to lie to upper management about any problems or lack of velocity on things, until eight months go by and it turns into a huge problem. If the company was more honest and transparent with itself these issues wouldn't arise. It's really absurd, and an awful way to run an organization.  It can feel like you're working on an assembly line just focusing on your small part of the problem, without any exposure to the greater picture. This is extremely demoralizing. Also, TDG tends to hire senior developers and then put them in junior roles where everything is top-down, and you're not given any freedom to think for yourself. ",
