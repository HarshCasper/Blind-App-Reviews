3,Leads by focusing on gender & racial differences than on unity,It’s a job. You get a paycheck every few weeks.,Current management and HR prioritize focusing on differences and categorizing employees to hire and promote those they deem are part of traditionally underrepresented and traditionally disadvantaged groups. Indeed the Today@Apple weekly e-newsletter is a vehicle that on the surface spotlights diversity but actually encourages all employees to focus on individual differences and self-segregate into groups focused on activism instead of coming together as one - the message is never one of stronger together.

My boss is constantly asking me if I know about X or Y other team, what exactly they are working on, how we can best collaborate with them, or what their timelines are. If my boss doesn't know, how should I know?I have a rough overall picture, but I'm missing exact details about what other teams are doing. I've got 50+ top secret disclosures in the company and still I don't know what our closest collaborators are doing besides the tiny trickle of information they give us. This leads to a really toxic culture where managers are able to lie through their teeth at one another about how great their teams are and what they're working on. Because nobody actually knows anything there's no way to verify any claims. This goes vertically as well. Managers tend to lie to upper management about any problems or lack of velocity on things, until eight months go by and it turns into a huge problem. If the company was more honest and transparent with itself these issues wouldn't arise. It's really absurd, and an awful way to run an organization.  It can feel like you're working on an assembly line just focusing on your small part of the problem, without any exposure to the greater picture. This is extremely demoralizing.
