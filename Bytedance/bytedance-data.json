Random people are added to meetings, making the duration of the calls excessive, especially if they start talking.  Often, it's not even a topic that they understand or should be speaking about.  Also, large meetings are scheduled when it's something that can be hashed out in 5 minutes.  It's possible that this is a way for them to let everyone know that they are doing work.TikTok takes on the China culture of throwing bodies at problems, rather than working on improving processes.The processes are so inflexible that we have no choice but to throw more bodies at problems.95%+ of the people on my team are incapable of performing their role effectively.

After a few months, these shifts have become standard. Only one person is granted to do the early shift for one week, maximum. Everyone else works in the night shift and on weekends plus holidays. Extra pay is the lawful minimum.- Days off are completely random, could be a Monday and a Thursday this week. A Sunday and a Tuesday next week. 6/7 day in a row work weeks are commonplace.- 6 month probation period, during which 70% of the team has been fired by the supervisor while they were sick or on holidays. The HR guy didn't even bother to inform them.- During the job interview, the senior recruiter lies about possibilities in the company. But you have to wait out the 6 month probation period.

Blames the whole world. Needs to be told by lower-ranking team members how to do job.- Constant lies about reasons for radical changes or why there isn't any new staff hired to take the pressure off the workload. Blame is always put on China, where in fact only the local supervisor decides these things.- As the office in which its located doesn't have staff operating after 17:00 the air-condition is either off and leaves it smelling like a dump or on freezer mode and leaves everyone sick. Windows can't be opened. Dishes aren't done during the weekends; toilets smell like a sewer.- Pay is terrible, especially considering the toll it takes on personal health and family life.",

It's the supervisor's job to supervise, not anyone else's.- People who do the work well are fired left right and center, and then the management wonders why morale is low. Out of 60 that started 3 are left.- Equal pay is not a thing here, some are 24k a year, some 50k a year for the exact same job.",

This is true at both decision making/approval and low-level engineering work. In both cases there needs to be extensive collaboration. As a result, expect the following.    * Work-life balance can vary between different orgs, but, very likely, it's going to be bad. Due to time zone difference it means work out of US work hours.    * Expect language and cultural barrier if you don't speak mandarin. The level of speaking English in China teams can vary, but for engineers it's usually bad. Meetings are sometimes held in mandarin.* Company culture is very closed.
