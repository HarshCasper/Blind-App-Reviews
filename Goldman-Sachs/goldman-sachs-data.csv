4,Increasingly a great place to be a developer because it has made technology as a business,"I am deliberately writing a detailed review. Hope it is helpful :) In GS, there are an increasing number of tech teams which are full fledged tech products. I am in one of them. When a company makes tech as its business instead of tech as just a support, it leads to:- More ambitious projects.- Better team culture for growth and learning- The benefits of working in a product based team - building a product used by actual external users- Better opportunitiesPros are often team dependent. For my team, I like:- the fact that I get to work on a tech product- good compensation. - I am surrounded by some awesome people. Both as developers and as team mates- team culture is awesome- wlb is good!- manager is really supportive, engaging and super understanding- exposure to basic and complex finance concepts without actually working in a finance/trading desk teamGS is a bank, so:- the bonus component can be pretty huge.- potentially higher increments","GS is highly regulated, so:- In most cases, you cannot trade stocks, crypto etc. Only Mutual Funds.- Outside activity which has side income is quite regulated. For example, it won't be easy to do a side business, work as a volunteer developer, be on a leadership position in communities etc. Basically anything where you're getting any sort of compenstation or are managing something is highly regulated- Many regulations apply to your dependents and people you are living with. For example, you'll need to disclose statements of your dependents, and even they cannot be doing short term trading (buying and selling the same stock within 30 days)GS is a bank, so:- usually not so great in handing out money. For example, no free food, the wfh allowance is lesser compared to other companies.- Has been very eager to call people back to office. I have heard of no remote-only positionsIn addition:- In GS, you work on an NDS. This means your actual system is hosted in NYC, while sitting in your office you do a remote login. It's essentially teamviewer, just slightly better. But you can imagine how annoying the lag on the system can become. I have become habituated. - some teams have terrible WLB because of time zones.- some teams are saturated.

In a nutshell, it can be a good springboard to a better job elsewhere.","The firm is in terminal decline. It may be doing better financially than it almost ever has, but its unwavering focus on strategic locations and underpaying individuals has done tremendous damage to the quality of its people and its services, even during a period as short as the past four years I've worked there. GS prides itself on paying its employees less than market - either by encouraging internal mobility from its back to its front office and then never catching those individuals up to their peers (i.e., cheap labor for higher value work), by hiring new engineers almost exclusively in SLC, Dallas, and Bangalore, or by raising salaries for new analysts (as happened earlier this year) and then not adjusting salaries for earlier analyst classes, thereby causing ire among thousands of hires who have stuck around to keep the firm running. Also, its name is no longer the silver bullet in recruiting that it used to be. The market is well aware that the GS mystique is more or less gone, and this is just another investment bank like Citi or JPMorgan Chase, so don't count on good job offers to flow your way after a few years unless you are in IBD or certain groups in GMD/AMD. The amount of internal politics to get ahead and get compensated as you think you should at a place like GS is extraordinary - your MD holds all the cards for your career, and if he or she is not invested in you, then you are simply wasting your time as another GS drone. I haven't even touched on the level of bureaucracy, often enforced by absolutely miserable individuals in Compliance and CWS in Bangalore and SLC who I secretly think enjoy blocking and frustrating the front office individuals wherever possible.","Verified User Current Employee a********* Global Markets Associate - Nov 17, 2021",

1,"If you manage to retain your sanity after working here, then you're truly a saint","This is hard, because there aren't any. I guess you could tell people that you work at Goldman and then they're supposed to think you're amazing and you could use that to boost your ego.","Oh man, where do I even start?If you're one of few the lucky people on this planet that have never met a narcissist before, then brace yourself, because Goldman is full of the most self-centered, narcissistic snobs earth has to offer. Words like modesty and humility simply do not exist in their dictionaries. Many of them come from mega rich families, have attended prestigious ivy league schools and studied some tough subjects like chemistry and philosophy in college, but have now found their lives' fulfillments as glorified bond salesmen at Goldman Sachs. If you work in investment banking, preferred to be called IBD by the Goldman narcissists, then congrats! You'll soon find that working 100+ hours per week is the norm and you're supposed to feel really proud of it despite the fact that you have no social life and your work adds zero value to society. Even though you work 100+ hours, most of your daytime hours are spent doing very little work, your real work usually starts late afternoons or early evenings, when your VP or MD would ask you to prepare an important PowerPoint deck, preferred to be called a pitchbook by Goldman Narcissists, that they need for a 9am client presentation next day. Your hours between 6pm-3am will be spent crunching numbers on Excel spreadsheets, preferred to be called financial models by Goldman Narcissists, and you'll be accompanied by endless cups of coffee and constant F bombs dropped by your coworkers left and right.If you're just starting out, you'll begin your career as an ANALyst, or an ASSociate if you're hired out of an MBA. You'll start with training/orientation where they'll tell you how entrepreneurial this place is or how flat of an organization they have. These words may sound nice, but they mean something totally different in reality. Entrepreneurial means the place is a mess, you'll need to figure out just about everything on your own with very limited coaching, it's always a sink or swim situation. Flat organization means you'll have multiple bosses, again using investment banking as an example, you'll most likely work on multiple deal teams, and every VP, MD or even ASSociate can influence your performance rating. Get ready for some serious hazing that even college fraternities would frown upon and good luck progress through the ranks.You might think that Goldman pays well, but truth is that Wall Street pays less than Silicon Valley and Goldman has the lowest starting total comp out of all major Wall Street banks. Though this is not saying much, because you'll see the same problems at places like JPMorgan, but at least with slightly better pay, you can say the diarrhea I had today (JPMorgan) is better than the diarrhea I had the day before (Goldman).Most people don't make it at Goldman, there is a reason that plenty of ANALysts voluntarily exit after just two years and choose to work in private equity, hedge funds or a traditional corporate finance job. With all this, it's truly amazing that thick skins like Lloyd Blankfein would describe themselves as doing God's work, I guess you need that to keep the narcissists feel good about themselves.Goldman Sachs, and Wall Street in general, is losing its prestige fast.
